# Synthetic Farming

## Single-cell organisms
Cellular agriculture refers to the cultivation of single-celled organisms for food. In some form, cellular agriculture goes back centuries in the cultivation of yeast and algae. Expanded use of new techniques could radically transform food production.

Today, single-cell organisms are typically grown from agricultural residue, thus inheriting the environmental impacts of conventional farming. Even so, expanded use of such organisms could reduce impacts.
