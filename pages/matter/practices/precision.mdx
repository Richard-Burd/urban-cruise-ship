# Intensification

Beyond biotechnology, several emerging technologies have the potential to allow more crop production with fewer impacts.

## Precision Agriculture
Precision agriculture is the use of technologies such as GPS, soil monitoring, and data analytics to optimize planting schedules, application of fertilizer and water, and other farming operations. Data on the potential benefits of precision agriculture techniques is limited; following are ranges of results found in a recent meta-analysis.

## Plasma
A nonthermal plasma is a type of plasma that is not in thermal equilibrium, in that the electrons are at a very high temperature and disassociated from atomic nuclei, but the ions are at a lower temperature. Nonthermal plasmas has a variety of industrial uses, and they are being actively developed for seed treatment and increased yields in agriculture [^1], [^3], [^5]. Possible uses are as follows.

<div className="table-wrapper">

| Agricultural Phase | Uses of Nonthermal Plasma |
| --- | --- |
| Seed Treatment | Supply reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, kill bacteria and fungus |
| Plant Treatment | Increase yields, nutritional enhancement, decontamination, reduce water need |
| Food processing | Decontaminant, other uses |
