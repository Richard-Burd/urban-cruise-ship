# Conservation Agriculture
Conservation agriculture, a general practice that entails minimal or no tillage of soil, accounted for 12.5% of world cropland as of 2015/16 and is rapidly becoming more common [^6].

## No-till Farming
Under no-till farming, a new planting is done through the residue of the old rather than through tilling. The following increases in yields from no-till farming have been estimated from several studies.

Avoiding tillage may allow the soil to sequester more carbon, though this effect is disputed. The following are the soil carbon sequestration potential of no-till farming, as estimated from several studies. Under the largest estimate, applied over 1.5 billion hectares of cropland, the theoretical carbon sequestion potential is the equivalent of 5.5 billion tons of CO2, or a bit over 10% of world emissions.

The following additional benefits and drawbacks of no-till farming have been estimated.
