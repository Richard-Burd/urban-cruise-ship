# Conservation Agriculture
Conservation agriculture, a general practice that entails minimal or no tillage of soil, accounted for 12.5% of world cropland as of 2015/16 and is rapidly becoming more common [^6].

## No-till Farming
Under no-till farming, a new planting is done through the residue of the old rather than through tilling. The following increases in yields from no-till farming have been estimated from several studies.

Avoiding tillage may allow the soil to sequester more carbon, though this effect is disputed. The following are the soil carbon sequestration potential of no-till farming, as estimated from several studies. Under the largest estimate, applied over 1.5 billion hectares of cropland, the theoretical carbon sequestion potential is the equivalent of 5.5 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, or a bit over 10% of world emissions.

The following additional benefits and drawbacks of no-till farming have been estimated.

## Cover-cropping

Cover-cropping is an important aspect of regenerative agriculture, with many purported benefits [^16]. One benefit is carbon sequestration potential, though studies vary widely as to how great this may be.

#### Sources: Blanco-Canqui [^11] and Poeplau and Don [^12].

Poeplau and Don [^12] also estimate that the world potential carbon sequestion for cover cropping is 120 million tons of carbon per year, or 320 million tons CO<sub>2</sub>, about 8% of world emissions.

Cover cropping is estimated to reduce yields of maize (corn) by 5.5% and soybeans by 3.5% [^13]. Cover cropping requires additional land use in providing the seeds of 3.8% of the land covered [^14].

As of 2017, 5% of United States cropland was under cover crops [^15].
