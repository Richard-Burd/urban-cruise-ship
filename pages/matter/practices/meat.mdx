# Meat and Animal Products

In this section we consider several aspects of meat consumption. See also our analysis of seafood.

## Consumption Trends
Meat consumption, as a share of total diet, has been increasing worldwide and varies considerably by country and region.

#### Source: FAOSTAT [^11].

Historically, increased wealth has been associated with a "nutrition transition", or a move to diets heavier in meat and dairy [^7]. The evidence is that humans have an innate preference for energy-dense foods, particularly those heavy in fats and sugar [^8].

#### Figures are derived from the Food Balances data from FAOSTAT [^11].

## Environmental and Welfare Impacts
Animal products, especially beef, tend to have much greater land use, greenhouse gas, and water impacts than plant-based products.

The feed conversion efficiency of an animal (or substitute) is the ratio of input feed to edible output product, measured by mass. Feed conversion efficiency is highly correlated with lifecycle land use and greenhouse gases [^2].

<ArticleImage image={"fcr.svg"} width={740} height={650} />
#### Data sources: Alexander et al. (2016) [^2] for poultry, pork, beef, lamb and mutton, eggs, and milk; Alexander et al. (2017) [^1] for mealworm, crickets, tilapia, Chinese carp, cultured meat, and imitation meat; Froehlich et al. [^12] for crustaceans. Values vary depending on the choice of feed, method of raising animals, and other factors.

Following is an estimate of the number of animals that are slaughtered, or that are required to produce over their lifetimes, to provide 5% of a human's lifetime nutritional needs.

#### Sources: Compassion in World Farming [^5], FAO ([^9], [^10], [^11]).

In the United States, the trend has been toward more efficient beef production, though not at a rate that is sufficient to fundamentally change beef's high impacts relative to other foods.

On metrics such as yield per animal [^11], meat production tends to perform better in wealthier countries than in poorer countries.

## Animal Feed
Livestock feed is derived as follows

<ArticleImage image={"feed_sources.svg"} width={620} height={370} />
#### Source: Xu et al. [^22].

About 5% of feed by mass, 6% by calories, and 8% by protein is converted into meat that is sold [^22].

Following is a comparison of estimated impacts of grass-fed beef, relative to feedlot beef.

<ArticleImage image={"grass_fed.svg"} width={900} height={680} />
#### Sources: Clapper [^4], Lupo et al. [^15], Tichenor et al. [^19].

Grass-fed cattle may play a role in sequestering carbon in the soil, though the magnitude of this effect is of considerable controversy. Even with the sequestration effect, the lifecycle emissions of grass-fed beef is likely to be only marginally lower than those of feedlot beef [^15].

As an additive to animal feed, seaweed has the potential to reduce enteric fermentation by 50-95% [^14][^18].

Insects [^21] and algae [^17] are of interest as a partial replacement for fishmeal in feed for cattle, poultry, and aquaculture.

## Potential for Dietary Shift
Price is not necessarily a barrier in shifting to established meat alternatives.

<ArticleImage image={"protein_price.svg"} width={950} height={600} />
#### Sources Bashi et al. [^3], Diet & Fitness Today [^6], FAO [^9], IndexMundi [^13].

It is unclear if emerging meat alternatives, such as cultured meat, will be better able to gain consumer acceptance than established alternatives. Such acceptance depends on politics and culture, in addition to cost, taste, and nutrition [^20]. Furthermore, in wealthier countries, protein and fat intake already exceed healthy levels [^20].

It has been found that a 10% reduction in the cost of plant-based meat should reduce U. S. cattle production by 0.15%, suggesting that a market-driven shift toward plant-based meat will not be sufficient to displace meat significantly [^16].

## Hunting

Hunting is a small but nontrivial share of food intake, even in wealthy countries. In Michigan, for instance, hunted venison comprised about 1% of all animal products consumed [^23]. There is a misconception that conservation in the United States is funded mostly by hunting activity. Of federal and philanthropic conservation funding, 6.1% (about $1.3 billion of $21 billion) is estimated to come from hunters [^24]. At the state level, about an additional $800 million is raised through hunting license fees, and this also goes mostly to conservation [^25]. The dependence of state conservation on hunting--an activity which is in a state of decline--jeopardizes conservation funds [^26].

<ConservationGeneralFundSolution />

"Bushmeat" refers to game hunted for wildlife, most frequently for subsistence in low-income countries. At least 5.7 million tons of bushmeat are harvested per year worldwide, about 2% of total animal products [^27]. In some rural areas of West and Central Africa, bushmeat constitutes 80-90% of animal protein, and it is also a major contributor in the Amazon basin [^27].

Reliance on bushmeat places great pressure on ecosystems [^27]. Additionally, bushmeat is a major vector for zoonotic diseases. It now appears probable that the transition to humans of the HIV virus occurred through infected bushmeat [^28]. The 2014 West Africa ebola outbreak and other ebola outbreaks may have be linked to bushmeat [^29].

## Pet Food

Globally, the market for vegan pet food was $9.6 billion in 2020 [^30], for plant-based pet food was $26.10 billion in 2022 [^31], and for pet food overall was $112.13 billion in 2021 [^32].

Dogs and cats can be as healthy on vegan diets as they are on meat-based diets, but they--especially cats--require nutritional supplements [^33].
