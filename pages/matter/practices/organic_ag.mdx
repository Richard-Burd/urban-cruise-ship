# Organic Agriculture

Organic farming is a system that avoids synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, genetically modified organisms, growth hormones, and antibiotics, and encourages the use of local seeds, measures to improve soil fertility, pasture, and other tools to support natural animal behavior [12]. It may be sensible to adopt the best aspects of organic agriculture but to avoid dogmatic adherance [26].
