# Indoor Farming

Indoor farming techniques--greenhouses, hydroponics, and vertical farming--tend to greatly decrease land and water use, relative to conventional farming, while also greatly increasing energy use.

## Greenhouses
Greenhouses are an increasingly widely used tool for producing vegetables [^10]. Greenhouses are estimated to have the following environmental impacts relative to outdoor farming, often spending more energy to save land and water.

#### The above figures are the range of estimates sources as follows: land use [^6], [^22], energy [^4], [^6], [^16], [^19], greenhouse gases [^4], [^6], eutrophication [^4], [^6], acidification [^4], [^6].

Following is an illustration of the energy required to produce all world tomatoes from greenhouses.

#### Energy requirements are the 25th and 75th percentiles figures for greenhouse tomato production as reported by Clark and Tilman [^6]. The wide range of estimates account for widely varying climates, types of greenhouses, and study methodologies. Overall tomato and food production is determined from FAOSTAT [^11]. Due to the wide variation in life cycle analysis results, precise figures are not available.

Greenhouses can be used to grains, such as barley [^4], but the environmental case for doing so may be weaker than it is for vegetables.

The Netherlands is the world leader in effective use of greenhouses. They have drastically cut water and pesticide usage, and the Netherlands, a country that is not naturally well-suited for agriculture, is the number two food exporter by monetary value.

## Hydroponics
Hydroponics--the practice of growing plants with a nutrient solution instead of soil--may also save land and water at the cost of greater energy consumption. The following impacts, relative to open field farming, have been estimated.

<ArticleImage image={"hydroponics.svg"} width={950} height={400} />
#### Numbers are highly uncertain due to limited data and wide variance in both hydroponic and open field practices. Sources: [^1], [^3], [^5], [^15], [^17], [^20].

Over 80% of the energy consumption identified by Barbosa et al. [^3] is for heating and cooling, an area for which a clean source of low-temperature industrial heat would be valuable. Passive ventilation [^3] and efficient LED lighting [^21] would also save energy.

Related growing techniques are aquaponics, which is a symbiotic combination of an aquaculture and hydroponic system, and aeroponics, which does not use a growing medium. Their water, fertilizer, and land use impacts have been estimated as follows.

#### Source: AlShrouf [1].

An aquaponics system can save fertilizer consumption by using excretion from the fish [^18]. An aquaponics system designed specifically for Martian astronauts has been estimated to require 10 square meters per person without stacking [^12].

Labor intensity is a barrier to expansion of hydroponics [^8] and aquaponics [^14], which can be addressed through greater automation.

## Vertical Farming
Vertical farming is the concept of growing food in layers. This may refer to the food-producing skyscrapers described by Dickson Despommier [^9], or more commonly, any indoor growing that relies mostly on artificial lighting [^7]. Even more so than greenhouses, vertical farm conserves land and water at the cost of additional energy consumption.

#### Source: Hallikainen [^13].

Most of the energy cost of a vertical farm is for artificial lighting, and vertical farms also have higher labor costs per unit product than other forms of farming [^2]. Due to high energy and other costs, vertical farms for the foreseeable future will probably be confined to producing leafy greens, herbs, and berries, which together constitute 6% of global caloric intake [^23].
