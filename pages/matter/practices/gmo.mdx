# Genetic Engineering

Genetic modification (GM), or genetic engineering (GE), refers to any technique of modifying crop genetics through transgenics or direct editing. The most common modified traits today are herbicide resistance and insect resistance [5]. Both the range of traits engineered for and the techniques for doing so are likely to expand greatly in the coming years [5]. Currently, about 10% of world crops, by planting area, use biotechnology [9].

Current GM technology has brought about the following estimated increases in crop yields.
