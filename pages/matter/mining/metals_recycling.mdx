# Metals Recycling

## Recycling Rates
Recycling rates vary widely by metals, but for most metals, including those critical for a renewable energy transition, recycling rates are low.

The International Energy Agency has also compiled some recycling rates by metal, which are a bit lower than the figures reported by UNEP above. For most metals, reliable figures are difficult to ascertain.

The optimal recycling rate for a given metal is likely less than 100%, because the last few uses of a metal tend to be very diffuse and energy-intensive to recover [^4].

## Use of Recycled Metals
With overall growth in mineral demand, the rate of use of recycled metals (secondary production) is less than the recycling rate, but it is substantial.

## E-Waste
E-waste refers to appliances, computer equipment, and other electronics that have reached the end of their useful lives. As electronics are a major use of metals, e-waste is a major issue in metals recycling, and it is also a significant health concern. E-waste recycling rates remain low.

As retiring electric cars become more common, recycling and reuse of EV batteries will become more important [^3].
