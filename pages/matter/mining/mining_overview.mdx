# Mining Overview

## Production Overview
Sand and gravel are by far the most widely mined materials by mass. The world produced the following minerals.

#### Minerals for which world production is above one million tons per year in 2020, according to the U. S. Geological Survey [^4]. Sand and gravel figures from the Visual Capitalist [^3].

Metal production in the world is as follows.

#### Leading nonferrous (i.e. not iron) metal production in the world as of 2020 [^4].

Precious metal production is much less than the bulk commodities above, but these metals drive both disproportionate economic value and environmental impact.

#### Production of select precious metals worldwide in 2020 [^4].

## Production Growth
The demand for minerals could grow considerably in coming years, especially minerals that are needed for clean energy technology.

In monetary terms, the demand for clean energy minerals is likely to overtake the demand for coal in the 2030s [^2].

There is no threat of long-term shortage of minerals, but due to long lead times--up to 20 years from the discovery of mineral deposits to production--rapid growth may result in short-term supply crunches.

## Mining Techniques
Mining can generally be divided into two techniques: surface mining and underground (or sub-surface) mining. In the United States, surface mining is predominately used.

## Phytomining

Phytomining is the technique of using plants to bioaccumulate and harvest minerals [^pm1]. Relatedly, phytoremediation is proposed to clean heavy metals such as nickel from soils. Nickel, manganese, cadmium, zinc, arsenic [^pm2], noble metals such as silver, gold, and platinum-group metals [^pm3], and rare Earth elements [^pm4] have been proposed as mining candidates. It is hoped that phytomining will be economical for harvesting minerals from ore tailings or for ores that with too low concentration to otherwise be economical.

Due to the low land use efficiency of phytomining, the technique could have greater ecological impact per unit mineral harvested than conventional mining [^pm2]. So far, phytomining has not advanced beyond field trials [^pm2].

## Artisanal Mining

Artisanal mining (ASM), as opposed to industrial mining, is small scale mining conducted outside of purview of a major company, often in poor countries and by hand. A majority of worldwide mining employment, and a significant share of minerals, are mined via ASM.

<ArticleImage image={"artisanal_mining.svg"} width={660} height={220} />
#### Data available from the International Institute for Sustainable Development [^5].

ASM is most often an income supplement to small-scale agriculture, usually conducted in low-income countries and by hand [^5].

ASM, particularly for gold mining, is the largest source of mercury pollution worldwide, and other health hazards of ASM are exposure to lead, cobalt, cyanide, arsenic, cadmium, as well as noise and dust exposure and other impacts [^6]. ASM also contributes to deforestation and over-stripping of overburden [^7], water and soil pollution, and long-term damage through a lack of reclamation [^8].

## Conflict Minerals

The "resource curse" posits that countries rich in minerals or fossil fuels might, as a result, experience conflict and reduced economic growth. This is suggested in particular in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the mineral-rich East Kivu region has been in a state of conflict since 2004, pitting the Congolese government against rebel groups, including the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CND) and Mouvement du 23 Mars (M23). Many other groups, including the Islamic State, operate in the conflict [^9]. A provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Consumer Reform and Protection Act requires producers of gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten to certify that their minerals do not finance the Kivu conflict [^10].

It has been argued that Kivu's mineral wealth incentivized rebels to initiate the war out of a profit motive [^11]. However, it is likely that the financial motivation of mineral wealth plays only a minor role in fueling the conflict [^12],[^13].

The Kimberly Process Certification Scheme is designed to certify the origins of diamonds and prevent conflict diamonds from entering the mainstream market [^14]. However, the effectiveness of the Kimberly Process in preventing human rights abuses has been questioned [^15].
