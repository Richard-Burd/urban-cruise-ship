# Mining Overview

## Production Overview
Sand and gravel are by far the most widely mined materials by mass. The world produced the following minerals.

#### Minerals for which world production is above one million tons per year in 2020, according to the U. S. Geological Survey [^4]. Sand and gravel figures from the Visual Capitalist [^3].

Metal production in the world is as follows.

#### Leading nonferrous (i.e. not iron) metal production in the world as of 2020 [^4].

Precious metal production is much less than the bulk commodities above, but these metals drive both disproportionate economic value and environmental impact.

#### Production of select precious metals worldwide in 2020 [^4].

## Production Growth
The demand for minerals could grow considerably in coming years, especially minerals that are needed for clean energy technology.

In monetary terms, the demand for clean energy minerals is likely to overtake the demand for coal in the 2030s [^2].

There is no threat of long-term shortage of minerals, but due to long lead times--up to 20 years from the discovery of mineral deposits to production--rapid growth may result in short-term supply crunches.

## Mining Techniques
Mining can generally be divided into two techniques: surface mining and underground (or sub-surface) mining. In the United States, surface mining is predominately used.
