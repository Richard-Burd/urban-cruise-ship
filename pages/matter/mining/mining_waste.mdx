# Environmental Impacts

Here we consider some environmental impact of mining. See also our analysis of [energy and greenhouse gas impacts](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/metals_materials) of mining and of [waste disposal challenges](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/waste/mining_waste2).

## Biodiversity Impacts
Mining takes an estimated 0.3-1.0% of the Earth's surface, though has a disproportionate impact of wildlife through long-lasting tailing pollution and acid mine drainage, which is the outflow of acidic water [^1]. The impact generally grows with the amount of tailings the mine produces.

## Water Use and Pollution
Mining has a wide range of impacts of water use and pollution.
