# Environmental Impacts

Here we consider some environmental impact of mining. See also our analysis of [energy and greenhouse gas impacts](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/metals_materials) of mining and of [waste disposal challenges](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/waste/mining_waste2).

## Land Use

As of 2020, mining was estimated to occupy 57,277 square kilometers of land worldwide [^8], with the following commodities dominant.

#### Source: Maus et al. [^8]. Note that some mines report more than one commodity mined.

Depending on the rarity of a material, the land use required to produce it can vary widely.

## Biodiversity Impacts
Mining takes an estimated 0.3-1.0% of the Earth's surface, though has a disproportionate impact of wildlife through long-lasting tailing pollution and acid mine drainage, which is the outflow of acidic water [^1]. The impact generally grows with the amount of tailings the mine produces.

## Water Use and Pollution
Mining has a wide range of impacts of water use and pollution.

## Enhanced Metal Recovery

Enhanced metal recovery (EMR) refers to a variety of methods to increase metals recovery from tailings, slag, sludge, or mining residue, increase the minerals that can be harvested from a given land area [^3]. EMR, including efforts to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide through enhanced weatherization for mining, is an active area of research [^4],[^5]. The potential for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction through mineralization for mining is estimate at 1.1-4.5 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year, or about 3-11% of current emissions [^6].

Recovery of metals from incinerator ash is also an active area of development [^7].

## Tradeoffs

No matter how or where it is done, mining comes with environmental costs. An example is the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada. If not built, however, the United States and other countries may source more lithium from Bolivia, where there too lithium mining has negative impacts on indigenous populations and society at large [^2]. Additionally, restricting lithium supply may delay the deployment of clean energy and prolong the usage of fossil fuels, with the negative impacts associated with those.
