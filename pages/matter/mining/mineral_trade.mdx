## Extractivism

"Extractivism" is a critical term against resource extraction based in capitalism and free trade. It is not necessarily a critique of all resource extraction, as a certain amount is required for human survival. For example, South America disproportionately exports natural resources and faces environmental impacts of doing so [^1].

Critiques of extractivism invoke "Indigenous" people as antagonists to colonizers and multinational corporations. In making such critiques, one should be careful of stereotypes of exceptional indigenous environmental stewardship [^2].
