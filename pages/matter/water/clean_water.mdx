# Clean Water and Sanitation
Access to clean water and sanitation is improving, but remains a major problem.

#### Deaths per capita taken from the Global Burden of Disease database[^1], with overall population figures supplied by the World Bank [^9].

## Clean Water Access
Access to clean water, defined as access to an improved water source or access to a safe drinking water supply, is improving but is still far from universal.

Although clean water challenges are concentrated in low-income countries, high-income countries are not immune. An estimated 1.6 million people in the United States lack indoor plumbing facilities [^6].

## Providing Clean Water
The cost of providing universal clean water access has been estimated at $1.04 trillion annually as follows.

#### Source: Strong et al. [^8].

These figures are more comprehensive than some other estimates and hence larger [^2][^5].

The benefit-cost ratio of basic water supply has been estimated at 6.8 [^3], 5.5 for access to sanitation [^4], and 2.0 for access to improved drinking water sources [^4].
