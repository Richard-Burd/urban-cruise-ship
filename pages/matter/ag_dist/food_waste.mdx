# Food Waste

## Food Loss Overview
It is estimated that about a third of all food grown or raised is lost prior to consumption.

## Preharvest Losses
Not included above is preharvest losses of food. Factors contributing to preharvest losses include diseases, animal pests, weeds, and abiotic stresses. For grains, these losses amount to about a third of what could be grown.

#### Data Source: [^6].

Better plant breeds could reduce these losses by 520 million tons (300 mmt preharvest losses and 220 mmt in storage) [^6].

## Postharvest Losses
Postharvest losses, generally considered in the harvesting and storage phases, vary widely.

#### Sources: [^1], [^5].

In addition to tonnage lost, postharvest losses take the form of a reduction of quality [^7]. A study by McKinsey estimates the worldwide annual cost of postharvest losses to be $60 billion [^2].

Better use of chemicals and other tools could reduce postharvest losses [^12].

## Overeating
Overeating, or the consumption of food in excess of recommended intake, is also a form of food waste.

#### Absolute impacts are reported by Toti, Di Mattia, and Serafini [^9]. Overall world agricultural impacts are determined as follows: mass, land use, and greenhouse gas emissions from FAOSTAT [^3] and water from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development [^10].
