# Food Waste

## Food Loss Overview
It is estimated that about a third of all food grown or raised is lost prior to consumption.

#### Losses by phase of production are compounding, meaning that the numbers are the share of product that enters the given phase that is lost during the phase. Poorer countries tend to have greater losses on the production side, while wealthier countries has greater losses on the consumption side. Source: Gustavsson et al. [^4].

## Preharvest Losses
Not included above is preharvest losses of food. Factors contributing to preharvest losses include diseases, animal pests, weeds, and abiotic stresses. For grains, these losses amount to about a third of what could be grown.

#### Data Source: [^6].

Better plant breeds could reduce these losses by 520 million tons (300 mmt preharvest losses and 220 mmt in storage) [^6].

## Postharvest Losses
Postharvest losses, generally considered in the harvesting and storage phases, vary widely.

#### Sources: [^1], [^5].

In addition to tonnage lost, postharvest losses take the form of a reduction of quality [^7]. A study by McKinsey estimates the worldwide annual cost of postharvest losses to be $60 billion [^2].

Better use of chemicals and other tools could reduce postharvest losses [^12].

## Overeating
Overeating, or the consumption of food in excess of recommended intake, is also a form of food waste.

#### Absolute impacts are reported by Toti, Di Mattia, and Serafini [^9]. Overall world agricultural impacts are determined as follows: mass, land use, and greenhouse gas emissions from FAOSTAT [^3] and water from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development [^10].

## Junk Food

Discretionary foods are those that contribute little to a person's dietary needs. They are typically high in saturated fat, sugar, salt, and/or alcohol [^14].
