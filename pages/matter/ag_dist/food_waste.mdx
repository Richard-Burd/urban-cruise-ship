# Food Waste

Food waste refers to food that reaches the consumer but is not eaten. We broaden the treatment of food waste to include food that is eaten but is of little to no nutritional value.

## Food Waste

Sources vary considerably on estimates of worldwide levels of food waste. No obvious pattern is visible for food waste by national income level in studies done by the United Nations Environment Programme.

#### Source: United Nations Environment Programme [^2]. Household food waste, reported on a per-capita basis, is discarded at the household, as opposed to food service or retail venues. The income brackets are delineated by income per capita thresholds. These measures confirm UNEP's measurements in 2021 [^15].

The UNEP report further found that food waste is 21 kg/cap/yr at the food service (e.g. restaurant, hotel, etc.) level and 13 kg/cap/yr at the retail level in high-income countries, while reliable estimates of these quantities for other income brackets were unavailable. None of these quantities could be estimated reliably for low-income countries.

However, studies by and van Den Bos Verma et al. [^6] and Barrera and Hertel [^4], using an energy balance approach, find generally higher levels of food waste in wealthier countries than in poor countries. Cowdard et al. [^5] make a similar finding.

## Overeating

Overeating, or the consumption of food in excess of recommended intake, is also a form of food waste.

<ArticleImage image={"overeat.svg"} width={710} height={280} />
#### Absolute impacts are reported by Toti, Di Mattia, and Serafini [^9]. Overall
world agricultural impacts are determined as follows: mass, land use, and greenhouse
gas emissions from FAOSTAT [^3] and water from the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development [^10].

## Junk Food

Discretionary food, or junk food, is that which contributes little to a person's dietary needs. They are typically high in saturated fat, sugar, salt, and/or alcohol [^14]. Junk food contibutes to overeating and obesity because it is low in fiber, pleasing to the taste buds, and offers high fat-, sugar-, and calorie-density [^1].
