# Processing and Packaging

## Packaging

Packaging requires a significant, though not the largest share, of the environmental impact of food. Following is an analysis of packaged falafel in the Netherlands, presented as a representative portrayal of food impacts.

#### Emissions are assessed on the basis of 1 kilogram of edible falafel. "Processing and Packaging" includes emissions in both the manufacture of the packaging and in the food packaging process. "End of Life" includes end-of-life treatment for both the packaging and any food waste. Source: Boone et al. [^1].

The same study examines overall impacts.

#### Source: Many impacts are aggregated into a single unit, called "points". Negative end-of-life impacts are possible due to resource recovery from recycling. Source: Boone et al. [^1].

Packaging plays an important role in protecting and prolonging the shelf life of food, thereby reducing [food waste](/matter/ag_dist/food_waste), though this role is not usually well-quantified [^3]. In low-income countries especially, appropriate packaging will reduce food waste at most stages of production [^4]. For example, a benficial lifecycle assessment has been found for anti-microbial coatings for milk containers, with the benefits of shelf life extension and waste reduction outweighing the cost of the coatings themselves [^2].
