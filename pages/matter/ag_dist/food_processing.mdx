# Processing

Some degree of food processing is necessary to extend shelf life, prevent spoilage, to kill harmful pathogens [^15], and for palatability [^16]. Food process can broadly be divided into three levels.

| Processing | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Primary | Livestock butchering, grinding wheat into flour [^9], milling [^10], jerky [^11] |
| Secondary | Fermenting, drying, salting, smoking, canning [^9], bread baking [^10], batter, grape juice, hot dogs [^11] |
| Tertiary | Ready-to-eat meals [^9], canned soup, frozen dinners [^10], corn chips, frozen pizza, bundled snacks [^11] |

In 2009, Carlos Monteiro proposed the four-level Nova classification of food processing [^12].

| Processing | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Unprocessed / Minimally Processed | Fresh or dried fruit, fresh or pastueurized milk, culinary herbs and spices [^13] |
| Processed Culinary Ingredients | Vegetable oil, iodized salt [^13] |
| Processed Foods | Fruit in syrup, canned or bottled vegetables in brine [^13] |
| Ultra-Processed Foods | Carbonated soda, ready-to-eat frozen meals [^13] |

There is not a universally agreed-upon definition of "ultra-processed foods", and while more highly processed foods tend to be higher in sodium, sugar, and fat, the level of processing is a highly imperfect proxy for a food's healthiness [^14].

| Nutrient | Recommended Daily Intake | Actual Daily Intake for American adults |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sodium | No more than 2300 millgrams, ideally 1500 or less [^17] | 3400 milligrams [^18] |
| Sugar | For men, 150 calories, and for women, 100 calories [^19] | 270 calories [^20] |
| Trans Fat | 0 [^21] | 5.6 grams [^22] |
