# Food Loss

Food loss refers to food that is lost during growing, harvesting, or distribution. Losses can be devided into preharvest and postharvest losses. These are disinct from food waste, which is that food that reaches the consumer but is not eaten.

## Food Loss Overview
It is estimated that about a third of all food grown or raised is lost prior to consumption.

#### Losses by phase of production are compounding, meaning that the numbers are the share of product that enters the given phase that is lost during the phase. Poorer countries tend to have greater losses on the production side, while wealthier countries has greater losses on the consumption side. Source: Gustavsson et al. [^4].

## Preharvest Losses
Not included above is preharvest losses of food. Factors contributing to preharvest losses include diseases, animal pests, weeds, and abiotic stresses. For grains, these losses amount to about a third of what could be grown. Historically, preharvest losses have caused major crop failures and severe famines. Possible examples include a drought-induced famine around 1198-1196 BC, precipitating the Bronze Age Collapse [^16]; flooding behind the Great Famine of 1315 in Europe [^17]; a brown planthopped outbreak that decimated the Japanese rice crop in 1733 and caused famine [^18]; and the potato blight behind the Great Famine in Ireland from 1845-1852 [^19].

Drought and pests (e.g. disease, insects, rodents) are the two leading causes of preharvest losses, according to surveys across several crops and countries [^20]. Other factors found by surveys include excessive rain, wind damage, weeds, freezes, and others.

Better plant breeds could reduce these losses by 520 million tons (300 mmt preharvest losses and 220 mmt in storage) [^6].

## Postharvest Losses
Postharvest losses, generally considered in the harvesting and storage phases, vary widely.

#### Sources: [^1], [^5].

In addition to tonnage lost, postharvest losses take the form of a reduction of quality [^7]. A study by McKinsey estimates the worldwide annual cost of postharvest losses to be $60 billion [^2].

Better use of chemicals and other tools could reduce postharvest losses [^12].

Mechanization of growing practices, as opposed to manual labor, reduces losses at multiple stages of the production chain for staple cereal crops.

As storage is a major source of postharvest losses, improved storage can reduce losses.

In the transportation of food, better cold chain infrastructure and shorter supply chains are suggested to reduce losses [^21].
