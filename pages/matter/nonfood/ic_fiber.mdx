# Fibers, Polymers, and Building Material

Some fibers, such as jute, kenaf, and flax, have the potential to save resources, as do synthetic alternatives for products such as rubber.

## Fiber Crops
The life cycle implications of three plants for producing fiber crops are as follows.

Flax fibers can be a substitute for glass fibers, saving overall environmental impact.

#### Source: van Dam and Bos [^9]. Impacts are measured in thousands of a 'point' (millipoints, or mPt), a measure that aggregates several environmental impacts into a single figure.

## Textile Fiber
Among fibers commonly used for clothing, silk generally has the greatest environmental impact.

## Cotton
Organic cotton generally has lesser impacts than conventional cotton.

## Rubber
Rubber, most commonly harvested from the plant Hevea brasiliensis [^6], is a widely used polymer, about half of which is used for tires [^3]. The life cycle impacts of producing rubber have been estimated as follows.

#### Sources: [^1] and [^7].

Synthetic (vulcanized) rubber is not used today for truck tires, due to its inferior abrasion properties, but this may change with newly discovered techniques [^2].
