# Pharmaceuticals and Specialty Chemicals

Specialty products that can be produced from plants include essential oils, pharmaceuticals, herbal health products, dyes and colorants, cosmetics and personal care products, plant protection products (e.g. biocides), and intermediate products for the preceding. About 100,000 hectares are under cultivation around the world for pharmaceuticals or cosmetics, though many of these products are also harvested from the wild [^4].

## Bioprospecting
Bioprospecting is the practice of searching for pharmaceutical or other products among wild plants and animals. It has been proposed as a mechanism for funding conservation. In biodiversity hotspots, the value of nature from bioprospecting has been estimated at $21 [^8] to $9177 [^6] per hectare. About 25% (range of 14-40%) of modern pharmaceuticals can be traced to wild sources [^3].

If the indigenous population is not compensated fairly for the use of native organisms, the practice of bioprospecting is sometimes known as biopiracy [^7].

## Pearls
Pearls, mostly produced in mollusks, are used primary for jewelry [^10]. Most pearls today are cultured, or produced in farms, with a minority of expensive pearls (natural) harvested from the wild and some imitation pearls [^9]. Most cultured pearls are currently produced in China [^12].

Pearl cultivation carries several environmental costs and risks, such as a disease that devastated the Japanese pearl industry [^1].

## Horseshoe Crabs
Horseshoe crabs are a species that lives in coastal waters and often comes to the beach for mating. Chemicals in the blood of horseshoe crabs can be used to manufacture a material known as Limulus amebocyte lysate, which is used in medical settings to detect certain bacteria [^5].

The loss is a threat both to horseshoe crabs themselves and shorebirds that depend on them. The development of a chemical called recombinant Factor C (rFC) could provide a synthetic alternative to horseshoe crab blood [^5].

Larger numbers of horseshoe crabs are killed annually for fishing bait [^2].
