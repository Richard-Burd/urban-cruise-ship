# Feeding the World
The world grows plenty of food to meet the needs of humanity, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, but land use is a challenge.

## Production Overview
From 2014 to 2017, the world produced the following crops annually.

#### Source: FAOSTAT [^14].

## Future Food and Land Needs
In the first half of the 21st century, the following increases in demand for food have been predicted.

#### Sources: Alexandratos and Bruinsma [^1], Ray et al. [^21], Tilman et al. [^26].

Increases in population and food consumption, as well as a shift to a carnivorous diet, should increase the land required to feed humanity, while increasing yields should decrease land requirements.

## Yield Trends
During the years of the Green Revolution in the second half of the 20th century, world crop yields grew rapidly. That rate of increase may be slowing.

<ArticleImage image={"yield_trends.svg"} width={810} height={450} />
#### Historical annual growth in crop yields, as reported by Our World in Data [^22] and FAOSTAT [^14]. For future overall annual yield growth projections, the FAO [^12] reports the conservative estimate and Mauser et al. [^18] report the optimstic estimate. Ray et al. [^21] provide estimates for yield growth for maize, wheat, rice, and soybeans.

While substantial yield improvements are still possible, the slowdown may be a sign of diminishing returns from plant genetics [^4].

## Malnutrition
World hunger is declining, but severe problems of malnutrition remain, and now more people suffer from problems related to an excess of food than insufficient food.

<ArticleImage image={"malnutrition_stats.svg"} width={800} height={550} />
#### Most nutrition-related statistics are reported by Development Initiatives [^10], except underweight adult data is from the World Health Organization [^28]. Historical world hunger rates reported by the FAO [^13].

On an energy supply basis, the world grows more than enough food to meet human needs.

## Impact of Food Prices
High food prices cause reduce consumption and cause malnutrition.

<ArticleImage image={"food_price_impact.svg"} width={640} height={400} />
#### Source: Green et al. [^16].

High prices, such as during the commodity price spike of the late 2000s, are a major contributor to malnutrition [^5], [^8]. Furthermore, high food prices force poor families to cut back on health care and education, setting back a country's development [^19]. Historically, a 1% rise in crude oil prices correlates with a 0.3% rise in food prices on average [^2].

The growth of the biofuels industry is tightening the link between food and fuel prices [^3]. The following food price increases from biofuel production have been estimated.

<ArticleImage image={"biofuel_food_price.svg"} width={750} height={400} />
#### Source: Chakravorty et al. [^6]. Most models show that biofuel production increase food prices--see the survey paper [^20]--though some research disputes this link, e.g. [^23].

Beyond the humanitarian implications, high food prices cause political unrest and fuel terrorism, creating security problems for the rest of the world [^17]. Disruptions to food supply, such as caused by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, cause serious problems [^17].
