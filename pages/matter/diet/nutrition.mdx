# Dietary Needs
Beyond calories, humans need a balance of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals to be healthy.

## Nutritional Needs
Humans need more than mere calorie count to survive. Following are estimates of needs by macronutrient, vitamin, and mineral.

## Diet and Health
In general, Americans consume too much added sugar, sodium, and saturated fat, and not enough valuable minerals.

Obesity, resulting primarily from eating too much food, is a growing problem.

Additionally, 39% of the world's adults are considered overweight [^7]. Obesity is linked with 4.7 million deaths globally per year [^7], one of the leading causes.

Complicating efforts to address malnutrition are food allergies, which affect about 10% of American adults [^3]. About 90% of food allergic reactions can be attributed to the following: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat [^4].

## Micronutrient Deficiency
Major nutrient deficiencies, their effects, and their pravalencies are as follows.

#### Sources: Biban and Lichiardopol [^1], Our World in Data [^6], and Roth et al. [^8].

About half of children around the world suffer from "hidden hunger", or some form of micronutrient deficiency.

Micronutrient defiency can be addressed, among other methods, through fortification: dietary supplements, food fortification (e.g. adding micronutrients to cereals and other foods), and biofortification (genetic engineering, such as adding Vitamin A to golden rice) [^6].

**Salt Iodization**

Because salt is commonly consumed and easy to fortify, iodization of salt is a preferred method to respon to iodine deficiency. The World Health Organization estimates that it costs 2 to 5 cents per person per year to iodize salt [^10].
