# Soil Health

There are several key issues in soil health: erosion, organic carbon content, contamination with metals and other pollutants, acidification, salinization, biodiversity, sealing with impermeable material, nutrient balance, compaction, and waterlogging [^3]. Following we consider erosion and soil carbon.

## Erosion
Worldwide, 20-30 billion tons of soil are lost to water erosion, and an additional uncertain amount to wind erosion [^3]. With water erosion causing an estimated $25/ton of damages (2020 dollars) [^1], erosion may cause at least $500-750 billion of damages worldwide every year.

Agriculture is the main cause of erosion [^5].

#### Conventional agriculture causes significantly more erosion than natural biological and geological processes, while [conservation agriculture](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/ag_practices) is comparable. Conservation agriculture is a farming methodology that, among other things, seeks to minimize soil disturbance by avoiding tilling. Erosion rates are global averages, and values can vary widely by location, though are generally higher in hillier terrain. Source: Montgomery [^6].

Agroforestry to create windbreaks [^12] and terracing on hilly terrains [^2] also help reduce erosion.

## Soil Carbon
The ability of soils to hold carbon is of great interest especially due to climate change. The transport of carbon in and out of soils is as follows.

Since the beginning of agriculture, soils have lost an estimated 133 million tons of carbon, or about 15 years of world CO2 emissions at current rates [^10], though estimates vary widely [^11].

Agriculture generally results in a loss of soil carbon, and conservion of land to other uses, especially forests, generally results in a gain.

## Arsenic
High concentrations of arsenic in soil can result in high arsenic in crops, causing health problems. Arsenic exposure causes bladder and lung cancer, diabetes, pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and other problems [^13]. Arsenic exposure is believed to cause 43,000 deaths in Bangladesh annually [^13].

The World Health Organization sets standards of at most 0.2 mg/kg (0.2 parts per million) arsenic concentration in soil and 50 micrograms/liter in drinking water [^7]. Arsenic concentrations in both the soil and water exceed these values in many parts of the world [^4]. Natural sources of arsenic are as follows [^4].

- Volcanic eruptions
- Ocean spray

Anthropogenic sources include the following [^4].

- Domestic and industrial waste
- Arsenic-containing pesticides
- Burning of arsenic-rich coal
- Contaminated soil amendments
- Mining, particularly goal mining
- Cattle dipping vats (an arsenic-containing solution to kill ticks)
- Chicken litter

One solution to soils contaminated by arsenic and other heavy metals is phytoremediation: the growing of plants or fungi to collect the metals out of the soil [^9]. Intermittent flooding of soils and iron-based soil amendments can also help reduce soil arsenic, and proper plant breeding can reduce the uptake of soil arsenic by plants [^7].
