# Soil Health

There are several key issues in soil health: erosion, organic carbon content, contamination with metals and other pollutants, acidification, salinization, biodiversity, sealing with impermeable material, nutrient balance, compaction, and waterlogging [3]. Following we consider erosion and soil carbon.

## Erosion
Worldwide, 20-30 billion tons of soil are lost to water erosion, and an additional uncertain amount to wind erosion [3]. With water erosion causing an estimated $25/ton of damages (2020 dollars) [1], erosion may cause at least $500-750 billion of damages worldwide every year.

Agriculture is the main cause of erosion [5].
