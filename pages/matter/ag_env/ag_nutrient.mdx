# Nutrient Cycles

Food production is the main source of nitrogen pollution. See our discussion of nutrient pollution for information on broader causes and ecological impacts of them.

## Food and Eutrophication
Agriculture is the main source of nitrogen and phosphorous runoff, which leads to eutrophication. Generally, meat and animal products lead to much greater eutrophication over their lifetime than plant-based foods.
