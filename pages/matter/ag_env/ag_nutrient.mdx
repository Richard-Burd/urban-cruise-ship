# Nutrient Cycles

Food production is the main source of nitrogen pollution. See our discussion of nutrient pollution for information on broader causes and ecological impacts of them.

## Food and Eutrophication
Agriculture is the main source of nitrogen and phosphorous runoff, which leads to eutrophication. Generally, meat and animal products lead to much greater eutrophication over their lifetime than plant-based foods.

#### Sources: FAO [^2], Poore and Nemecek [^5].

In addition to adopting plant-based diets, fertilizer runoff and eutrophication can be reduced through farming practices such as no-till and precision farming, and intensive farming methods such as greenhouses.

## Nutrient Availability
World economical reserves of phosphate rock, the main source of the critical element phosphorous in fertilizers, are between 60 [^8] and 69 billion [^4] tons, or about 270-310 years of production at 2014 levels [^4]. However, most known reserves are in Morocco [^4], posing a risk to security of supply, and reserve estimates are in doubt [^1]. There is not a clear reason to worry, but a thorough audit of reserves from an organization such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations would be of value.

The following phosphorous conservation opportunities have been estimated.
