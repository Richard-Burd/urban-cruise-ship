# Land Use in Agriculture

## Land Use
Agriculture is the largest land use impact that humans exert [^7].

#### See our land use analysis for more information on data sources.

Since 1961, world cropland area has been steadily growing, while pasture land may have peaked [^1].

#### Source: FAOSTAT [^5].

Following are estimates of land use required by particular crops.

#### Area needs of plant-based crops are taken from FAOSTAT [^5], with their Nutritive Factors database [^4] to convert to a calorie basis. Area needs for meat is taken from Clark and Tilman [^2]. Fish are assumed to be produced through aquaculture, using the area estimates to grow feedstock for the United States, as reported by Froehlich et al. [^6].

## Value of Land
From 1973 to 2000, land converted into agricultural use in the contiguous (lower 48) United States is estimated as follows.

#### In calculating these figures, we sum the low, median, and highest estimates of four times periods--1973-1980, 1980-1986, 1986-1992, and 1992-2000, rather than use the USGS figures for the full period 1973-200. These figures assess gross conversion of land into agricultural use, without subtracting agricultural land that is converted to other uses. Source: USGS [^8].

Valuation of ecosystem services that these lands provide varies widely. We estimate these valuations as follows.

#### Source: Ecosystem Services Partnership [^3]. Figures reported are the means of valuations of ecosystem services in the database. Means are trimmed with the top and bottom 10% of values removed.

Over these nearly 30 years, the annual ecosystem service gain/loss of agricultural conversion in the United States is estimated as follows.

#### Our calculations were done by valuing what the USGS classifies as 'Grassland/Shrubland' as the mean of the values reported for 'Grassland' and 'Woodland and Shrubland' from ESP, and identifying Forest, Agriculture, and Wetland as Temperate Forests, Cultivated Areas, and Wetland respectively, using only studies conducted in the United States for the latter.

A gain in services from converting grassland is about counterbalanced by a loss of services from converting forests and wetlands. Avoidance of expanding agriculture into ecologically sensitive wetlands can better maintain ecosystem service value.
