# Energy and Emissions in Agriculture

## Energy in Agriculture
Agriculture, including upstream energy to manufacture equipment, fertilizers, and pesticides, accounts for about 4% of world energy consumption.

Wealthier countries tend to have higher crop yields and higher energy inputs, suggesting a tradeoff between land use and energy consumption in agriculture [^8]. In 2011, energy accounted for over 30% of corn, sorghum, and rice production costs [^2], underscoring the importance of energy as a factor in food affordability.

The growing of crops is just a portion of energy consumption in the larger food system.

## Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Agriculture is estimated to be responsible for over a third of world greenhouse gas emissions.

#### Sources of agricultural greenhouse gases, with warming potential assessed by carbon dioxide equivalency. Source: Xu et al. [^10]. These estimates are somewhat higher than those made by FAOSTAT [^6].

Other aspects of the world food system, such as packaging and transportation, contribute 15-25% of the emissions detailed above [^9].

Following are estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from select foods.
