# Water in Agriculture

Major families of crops require water as follows.

#### Figures on plant-based crops are reported by [^2], and figures on animal products are reported by [^3]. The FAO's nutritive factors database [^1] is used to convert mass to calories for maize, wheat, almonds, and lettuce.

Drip irrigation reduces a farmer's water needs by about 30-50%, but this effect may be negated by reduced percolation into the soil [^5]. Drip irrigation also helps reduce nitrogen requirements, soil erosion, and plant disease, but has a higher capital cost [^4].

Highly [intensive](http://urbancruiseship.org/topic/foodwater/practices) forms of farming, such as greenhouses and hydroponics, can also drastically cut water usage.
