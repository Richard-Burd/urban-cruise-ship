# Wildfire Management

## Wildfire Trends
There is no clear trend toward increased wildfire worldwide, but several regions, such as the Western United States, have seen an increase in the last few decades [^5]. Climate change is responsible for over half of the increase in fuel aridity in California--the main factor contributing to fire intensity--since the 1980s and is expected to continue to exacerbate the threat [^1]. Damages in the United States vary widely by season.

Despite expanding human presence in wildfire-prone areas, most wildfire damage in the United States is caused by lighting-started fires.

Most wildfire deaths are caused by smoke exposure, with relatively few deaths directly from fires.

About 4% of global vegetated surface burns every year [^7].

We posit three key factors necessary for understanding and managing the wildfire risk: climate change, as noted above; the accumulation of forest biomass as a result of forest management practices; and the exposure of people and property to fire-prone areas.

## Fire Suppression
Fire suppression is the practice of aggressively suppressing wildfires. While fire suppression can prevent fire in the short term, the practice disrupts natural ecological cycles--of which fire is a part--and leads to an accumulation of biomass which increases the future fire risk. Fire suppression has been identified as a contributing factor to increasing intensity of Western wildfires since the 1980s [^3], [^6], [^13].

Controlled burns [^3] or allowing greater natural fires [^13] may be a more sustainable method for managing wildfire risk. Thinning, or the practice of removing smaller, more combustable trees from a forest, helps reduce wildfire risk [^2].

## Exposure to Risk
The wildland-urban interface is the collection of urban development that is exposed to wildfire risk. Development patterns in recent decades have increased exposure.

Wildfire fighting is paid for primarily by the U. S. Forest Service, and thus the costs of firefighting are externalized to both property owners and the states, cities, and counties that make land use decision [^10]. This may lead to more, or lower density, development in fire-prone areas than is optimal.
