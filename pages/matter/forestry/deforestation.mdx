# Deforestation

Deforestation is a major driver of harmful land use impacts, and deforestation is responsible for 2.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide annually [^4], about 6% of the total. Since 6000 BC, forest cover has decreased from about 47% of the Earth's land surface to 30%, though the rate of forest loss has slowed from 7.3 million hectares per year from 1990-2000 to 3.3 million hectares per year from 2000-2015 [^6].

## Drivers of Deforestation
Most deforestation is to clear room for expansion of agriculture and other crops. While the clearing of forests for cities gets much attention, this comprises a small portion of total deforestation.

Another way to look at drivers of deforestation is by crop. Beef and oil crops, such as oil palm for biofuels, are the most important drivers.

Other assessments of deforestation use somewhat different methodologies but come to similar conclusions (e.g. [^2], [^3]).
