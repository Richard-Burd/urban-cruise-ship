# Diversity

## Variation in City Size
Although larger cities tend to produce greater wealth, an economy needs cities of the full range of sizes, from rural areas to megacities. Good urban design should be relevant to cities at all scales.

#### Source: UN [^6]. An economy requires many industries, such as agriculture, mining, manufacturing, knowledge work, and more, each of which has different needs for space and for proximity to other people and firms [^1]. Additionally, the needs and preferences of individuals vary [^5]. Thus an economy needs cities of different sizes.

## Needs in Housing Stock
In the United States, young people are marrying later and having smaller families than in the past [^4], leading to a long-term decrease in the size of households.

Nevertheless, sizes of houses have generally been getting bigger.

The housing stock does not fully reflect demographic changes. As a result, there is a shortage of 1 bedroom housing units relative to larger ones.

#### Occupancy rate is as defined by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development: 1.5 people per bedroom. Figures are the average occupancy, weighted by population, of the largest 15 metropolitan areas in the United States. Source: Loh and Farrar [^4].

Surveys confirm that, while Americans larely prefer the single family detached home, there is significant demand expressed for alternative housing forms that is not being met.
