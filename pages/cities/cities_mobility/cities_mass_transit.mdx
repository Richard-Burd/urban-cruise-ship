# Mass Transit

Mass transit requires sufficient population density to be financially viable; otherwise, it doesn't tend to help cities much. See also our analysis of [energy used in mass transit](/energy/transport/transpo_transit).

## Density and Transit Viability
Mass transit, such as municipal buses and light rail, is financially infeasible below certain density thresholds. Following are some estimates of those thresholds.

#### Population density of select develoments are included for comparison. For some transit stops, residential density can be substituted with job density. Sources: [^1], [^4], [^5], [^6], [^7], [^8], [^10]. See also our analysis of the density of [different housing forms](/cities/cities_land_use/cities_high_density).

Several other factors influence the viability of transit, including the degree to which different kinds of uses are mixed [^2] and transit construction costs [^9].

## Assessing Light Rail Effectiveness ([PDF](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1LxyLLCDXQ6zqNXOfyeka3kv_Bekll0Of))
As a case study, we examined a proposed light rail system in Nashville. Light rail can be a highly effective solution in dense cities, but requires a high throughput to be successful. A light rail system with relatively few potential passengers per mile of line is not likely to be well used, as would likely be the case for the recently proposed light rail project in Nashville [^3].

The energy efficiency of a light rail system, as measured by passenger-miles per unit energy, can also vary widely, depending on how well-used a system is [^3].

#### Public Transit Systems perform best with high ridership, which has been a challenge throughout the U.S. across all public transit modes. While there is no way of knowing how systems will perform in the future, population size and system scale can be used to as a crude indicator of passenger throughput. The chart to the left shows that Nashville would be the second smallest urbanized area (as defined by the National Transit Database) with a Light Rail System in the U.S., and that larger populations tend to operate with greater efficiency. Source: National Transit Database (2016) -’Fuel and Energy’ and ‘Metrics’ data listings available at (https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/ntd-data) as of February 3rd, 2018 Notes: Light Rail mileage drawn from publicly available sources for each transit system reported. *This exhibit was prepared for a proposed Nashville Light Rail in April 2018.
