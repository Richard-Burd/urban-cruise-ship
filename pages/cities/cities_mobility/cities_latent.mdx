# Latent and Induced Demand

As travel becomes easier, faster, and less expensive, people tend to do more of it. Furthermore, different modes of transportation are not necessarily substitutes as one might expect. In some cases, they can be complements, in that growth in one mode will lead to growth in another.

Induced demand is not necessarily a bad thing, as allowing people to get around is why we build transportation systems in the first place. However, induced demand and complementarity effects must be taken into account when mitigating the negative impacts of transportation, such as pollution and congestion.

## Induced Demand for Driving
The principle of induced demand is well-established in the context of roads and driving: when more roads are built, more driving can be expected as a result. Following are estimates of the magnitude of the effect.
