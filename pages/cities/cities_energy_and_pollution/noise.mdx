# Noise Pollution

## Extent
Noise pollution, defined by a level of sound that is harmful to humans and the ecology, is pervasive in modern cities.

#### Sources: Iberdrola [^4], McAlexander et al. [^7], National Geographic [^12], CDC [^15], World Health Organization ([^16] and [^17]).

The biggest contributors to urban noise pollution are road traffic and aircraft [^2].

#### The Noise Annoyance Index, compiled by the statistical agency of Norway, is a measure of how often people complain about noise from a given source. Source: [^14].

## Impact
Noise pollution has severe, chronic impacts on human health, including disruption of the circadian rhythm and sleep patterns [^10], hearing difficulty, hypertension, high cholesterol [^5], and heart conditions [^9]. The following loss of quality of life has been found in Europe.

#### This study assesses disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost due to noise pollution from several factors. A full year is lost is a person dies prematurely, and a fractional year is lost for a health problem or disturbance, with the fraction determined by the severity of the disturbance. Source: [^18].

Noise pollution has been found to have a major negative effect on ecosystems, such as a decline of bird populations [^13]. In marine environments, noise has been implicated in a widespread loss of animals [^1], including invertebrates [^8].

The monetized impact of noise pollution has been estimated at around $25 billion per year in the UK [^19], or around $70 billion per year [^20] or $170 billion per year [^21] in France. It has been estimated that the social value of reducing environmental noise by 5 dB in the United States would have a social value of $3.9 billion per year [^22].

## Mitigation
Several strategies are available for cities to reduce noise pollution. From cars and roads, typically the largest source, cities can use quieter pavements and noise barriers [^6].
