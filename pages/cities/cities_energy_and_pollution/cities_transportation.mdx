# Transportation

In our analysis of automobiles, mass transit, active transportation, and other forms of transportation in an energy context, we looked at energy, greenhouse gas, and pollution implications of different transportation options. In this section we look at some wider impacts.

The following portrays the combined private and public cost per mile of transportation.
