# Thermal Transfer

District heating and cooling, enabled by high density, is one of the most effective ways to save energy on heating and cooling. See our analysis of heating and cooling for solutions in other areas.

## District Heating and Cooling and Density
Dense development allow a district heating system, or a district heating and cooling system, to be economically viable. District systems typically save energy, especially if powered by what would otherwise be waste heat. Conversely, building a district heating and/or cooling system can assist denser development, by allowing future buildings to save on dedicated HVAC infrastructure.
