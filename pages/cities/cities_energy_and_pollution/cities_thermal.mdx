# Thermal Transfer



District heating and cooling, enabled by [high density](/cities/cities_land_use/cities_high_density), is one of the most effective ways to save energy on [heating and cooling](/energy/cities/heating). See our analysis of heating and cooling for solutions in other areas.



## District Heating and Cooling and Density
[Dense development](/cities/cities_land_use/cities_high_density) allow a district heating system, or a district heating and cooling system, to be economically viable. District systems typically save energy, especially if powered by what would otherwise be waste heat. Conversely, building a district heating and/or cooling system can assist denser development, by allowing future buildings to save on dedicated HVAC infrastructure.

#### Energy requirements and viability of district heating and cooling. Sources: Population density threshholds for viability of DHC are estimated from Möller and Werner [^3]. Energy for district heating is estimated from Gudmundsson [^1] and for district cooling is estimated from Stellar Energy [^4].

## Sweden: District Heating and Cooling Success Story
Sweden is a world leader in the use of district heating, which provides over 50% of the country's residential and commercial heating needs [^8]. Only 3% of heating demand was met by district systems in 1960 [^8], but in the following decades, the Swedish government saw district heating as a solution to achieve several goals--reduce dependence on oil, spur the construction of new homes, and reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions--and invested accordingly [^8].

From 1980 to 2015, the carbon intensity of Sweden's district heating fell from about 325 grams CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent per megajoule to 65 grams/MJ [^5], driven in part by the country's high carbon tax, as coal and oil have been replaced by biomass, waste, combined heat and power systems, and excess industrial heat [^8].

Today, Stockholm is developing the Open District Heating concept, which would create a market for smaller heat providers, such as data centers, to sell heat in the district system [^5]. In recent years, Sweden has conducted pilot projects into using district heating for washing machines and dishwashers [^8]. As of 2014, district cooling systems delivered 3.6 petajoules, and this figure is growing at 8% per year [^8].
