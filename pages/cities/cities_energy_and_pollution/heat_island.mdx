# Urban Heat Island

Urban heat islands are regions around cities that experience higher temperatures as a result of energy use, lack of convection or evaporation due to loss of vegetation, and features such as roofs and pavement that absorb more heat than natural land.

## Extent
On average, heat islands add several degrees Celsius to large cities.

#### Sources: heat island effect in world cities by Estrada et al. [^3], US cities estimated by Imhoff et al. [^5], and humid and dry cities by Zhao et al. [^16].

The urban heat island effect tends to be greater in larger, more compact, and more circular (as opposed to elongated) cities [^17].

The urban heat island effect is responsible for 2-4% of observed global warming, with the rest caused by greenhouse gases and black carbon (79% and 18% respectively) [^6].

## Impact
About 166,000 people die every year from heat waves [^15], which cause health problems including respitory issues, heat stroke, and others [^13]. Estimates for how many of these deaths can be attributed to urban heat islands varies considerably.

#### Sources: [^2], [^4].

The urban heat island effect has been estimated to cause about $270 million (2020 US dollars) of net present value damage in Melbourne, Australia [^1]. Worldwide, it may cost about 3.4% of GDP in 2100 [^3]. The effect costs 14 large cities an estimated 0.068% of GDP in extra air conditioning costs alone [^10].

Urban heat islands have been linked with fish deaths [^13], among other ecological impacts.

## Mitigation
The urban heat island effect can be mitigated by increasing a city's reflectivity, such as through white roofs, and by planting more vegetation. Both strategies were found to have benefit-cost ratios greater than 1 in Austria [^7]. Such strategies were also found to save lives through reducing the severity of heat waves in Washington, D. C. [^8].
