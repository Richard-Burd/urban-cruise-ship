# Material Consumption

## Construction Materials

High-density homes, particularly apartments, save on construction resources relative to other forms of construction.

#### "Embodied" energy or emissions are the energy or emissions that were required to make the building material. Energy and emissions are estimated on an annual basis, assuming a 50 year life to the building. High density refers to a 15 story apartment building near downtown Toronto, and low density refers to an average detached house in a Toronto suburb. Source: [^1].

## Consumer Materials

Just as denser housing construction [saves embodied energy in the construction phase](/cities/cities_material_consumption/cities_construction), it also saves energy throughout the building's life in the form of consumer goods.

#### Urban homes are 90 m<sup>2</sup> apartments near downtown Brussels, and suburban homes are 130 m<sup>2</sup> detached single family homes in the suburbs of Brussels. Source: [^2]. 'Normal' homes refer to "a standard new construction built according to the minimal energy efficiency requirements based on the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive" of the EU. A 'Low Energy' house is one with "reinforced insulation and low space heating energy demand but with standard heat delivery systems". A passive home is "an extremely insulated and airtight passive house equipped with mechanical ventilation and a heat recovery system".
