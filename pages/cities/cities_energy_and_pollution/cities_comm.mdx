# Communications

Information technology has several important impacts on environmental and health outcomes. See also our analysis of energy in information technology.

## Usage Statistics
The use of electronics for communication has become pervasive worldwide.

#### Sources: Bankmycell [^3] and Pew Research Center [^21].

Usage time is also high, raising concerns about overuse.

#### Source: [^25].

Communication systems, whether cell phones, broadband Internet, or something else, require infrastructure that tends to be more expensive to provide, per user, in rural areas than in urban areas [^22]. This leads to a "digital divide", a gap in the quality of communications access in urban and rural areas.

#### Sources: Perrin and Atske [^20] and Winslow [^28].

The digital divide has a major impact of the ability to work [^1] or do schooling [^27] remotely, issues that have become particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Limited communications infrastructure, primarily in rural areas, costs the American economy hundreds of billions of dollars per year [^10].

## Impact on Travel
The relationship between the availability of telecommunications and the overall amount of travel is well-studied. The weight of evidence is that advancing information technology is leading to an increase in overall travel.

| Factor | Effect on Travel | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Smartphone Usage | Overall trips increased | Hong and Thakuriah [^14] |
| Overall communications expenditures | Mixed effects, but generally increases travel | Choo et al. [^5] |
| Overall communications | Decrease work travel in rural areas, increase social travel, increase travel overall | Clark and Unwin [^9] |
| Overall telecommunications | Incrase travel on net | Saloman [^23], [^24] |
| Overall telecommunications | Increases travel | Mokhtarian [^6], [^19] |
| Overall telecommunications | Increases travel | Mokhtarian [^18] |
| Mobile device usage  | Stimuates travel by allowing productive use of travel time | Lyons and Urry [^17] |

The effect of telecommuting in particular seems to be an increase in non-work travel but a decrease in overall travel.

| Telecommuting: Effect on Travel | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Reduces work travel | Helminen and Ristimäki [^12] |
| Increases non-work travel but reduces overall travel | Kim [^15], [^16] |
| Increases non-work travel, decreases travel overall | Balepur et al [^2] |
| Reduces overall vehicle miles traveled | Choo et al. [^7] |
| Reduces overall vehicle miles traveled | Herderson and Mokhtarian [^13] |

In the United States, about 29% of air travel [^26] and 23% of driving [^4] is for work commuting and business purposes, representing the most promising opportunities for substitution with telecommunications.

Virtual travel is not yet a full substitute for physical travel. For example, in-person academic conferences foster collaborations in a way that online conferences are not yet able to do [^8]. But it is a partial substitute, with, for instance, Internet connectivity fostering academic collaborations [^11].
