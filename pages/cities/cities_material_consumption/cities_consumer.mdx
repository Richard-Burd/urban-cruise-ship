#### Urban homes are 90 m2 apartments near downtown Brussels, and suburban homes are 130 m2 detached single family homes in the suburbs of Brussels. Source: [^1]. 'Normal' homes refer to "a standard new construction built according to the minimal energy efficiency requirements based on the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive" of the EU. A 'Low Energy' house is one with "reinforced insulation and low space heating energy demand but with standard heat delivery systems". A passive home is "an extremely insulated and airtight passive house equipped with mechanical ventilation and a heat recovery system".
