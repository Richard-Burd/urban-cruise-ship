# Construction Materials

High-density homes, particularly apartments, save on construction resources relative to other forms of construction.

#### "Embodied" energy or emissions are the energy or emissions that were required to make the building material. Energy and emissions are estimated on an annual basis, assuming a 50 year life to the building. High density refers to a 15 story apartment building near downtown Toronto, and low density refers to an average detached house in a Toronto suburb. Source: [^1].
