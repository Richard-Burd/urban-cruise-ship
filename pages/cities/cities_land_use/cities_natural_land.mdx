# Value of Natural Land

Land provides many valuable services, known as ecosystem services, such as air pollution reduction, attraction of tourism, hosting of bees and other pollinators, carbon sequestration, and other valuable functions. These services provide a quantifiable economic value [1]. These services may be lost when land is developed, representing a measurable loss of economic value.

## Value of Urban Land
From 1973 to 2000, about five million hectares (50,000 square kilometers) of land were developed into cities in the contiguous United States.
