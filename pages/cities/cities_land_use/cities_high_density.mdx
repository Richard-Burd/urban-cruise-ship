# Density, Energy, and Emissions

Urban density is one of the most important tools available to save energy in buildings, particularly heating and cooling energy. Density, together with other efficient urban designs, is one of the most effective tools to save energy from transportation. Furthermore, urban density, along with agricultural intensification, is one of the few options available to reduce the human land footprint that encroaches on biodiversity. Building dense cities is especially important in the rapidly growing and urbanizing developing countries.

## Urban Land Use
Residential land use and transportation infrastructure are the key factors in overall urban density.
