# Costs from Sprawl

Sprawl, or development patterns at a lower density than sensible, carries energy and ecosystem service costs, as well as financial costs as detailed below.

## Infrastructure and Service Costs
State and local governments spend most of their budgets on infrastructure, services, and subsequent resulting debt and pensions. The United States struggles to adequately fund infrastructure [4], and state and local governments chronically struggle with their budgets [1]. Inefficient urban development patterns are a major driver of these problems.

The following estimates costs in dollars per person per year for infrastructure and services based on the urban form. Insofar as they are not captured in property taxes or development fees, they are externalized costs.
