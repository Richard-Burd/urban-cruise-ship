#### Cost estimate of building a floating city, from the Seasteading Institute [^{"Hencken2014"}]. The cost is comparable, on a square foot basis, to the cost of real estate in the most expensive markets in the world: Manhattan and San Francisco [^{"NeighborhoodX2017"}], and Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, London, and Paris [^{"Siebrits2019"}]. The cost of floating cities is based on a hypothetical cost study, not real world construction projects.

Floating platforms may be useful for creating new land in expensive, land-constrained coastal cities, such as Singapore, as an alternative to environmentally costly land reclamation [^{"wangW2014"}].

## Reclaimed Land

Per square foot, the cost of land reclamation varies widely but is generally cheaper than the assessed cost of seasteading.

Reasons for reclaimed land developments include the need for more access to real estate in space-constrained cities and the desire to place certain facilities, such as airports, far from a city center. Military bases at the artificial islands among the Spratly Islands offer China a strategic advantage in the event of conflict [^{"spratly"}].
