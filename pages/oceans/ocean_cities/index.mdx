#### Cost estimate of building a floating city, from the Seasteading Institute [^{"Hencken2014"}]. The cost is comparable, on a square foot basis, to the cost of real estate in the most expensive markets in the world: Manhattan and San Francisco [^{"NeighborhoodX2017"}], and Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, London, and Paris [^{"Siebrits2019"}]. The cost of floating cities is based on a hypothetical cost study, not real world construction projects.

Floating platforms may be useful for creating new land in expensive, land-constrained coastal cities, such as Singapore, as an alternative to environmentally costly land reclamation [^{"wangW2014"}].
