# Plastic Pollution

## Extent
Plastics, a major portion of the chemicals industry, are of particular concern from a pollution standpoint. There are 75-150 million tons of plastic in the ocean today, of which an estimated 4.8-12.7 million tons entered the ocean in 2010 [1]. An estimated 0.5 to 1 million tons of this is discarded and lost fishing gear [12]. The World Wildlife Fund estimates that oceanic plastic pollution does $3.1 trillion of damage each year, or about $280,000 per ton of plastic in the ocean [2].

These costs translate into a cost of $0.68-1.36 per pound of wild-caught fish [15], in contrast to prevailing retail market fish prices of around $6-19 per pound [4].

## Sources
Poor waste management practices, rather than the absolute volume of plastic waste generated, is the main factor that determines how much oceanic pollution occurs.
