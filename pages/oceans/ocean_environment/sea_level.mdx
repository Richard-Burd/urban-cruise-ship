# Sea Level

## Sea Level Rise

Since 1993, world sea levels have been rising at about 3 millimeters per year, and this increase is accelerating at 0.1 mm/yr/yr [^{ 1 }].

Sea level will continue to rise through the 21st century, even if greenhouse gas emissions are brought under control.

Ice loss from Greenland is accelerating, with 120 billion tons of loss from 1901-1990 and 330 billion tons from 2006-2018. Rising sea levels are expected to exacerbat the damages from coastal storms and flooding [^{ 2 }]. The United States will have to spend an estimated $300 billion cumulatively by 2100 on seawalls [^{ 3 }].

## Ocean Circulation

The most serious change to ocean circulation has been the slowing of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. This is expected to cause disproportionate sea level rise on the East Cost of the United States and to reduce the oceans' ability to take up carbon [^{ 1 }].
