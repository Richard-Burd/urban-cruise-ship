## Biodiversity Status

As on land, biodiversity in the oceans is threatened.

Biodiversity ultimately depends on primary producers, which in the ocean is mainly plankton. While there is not yet strong enough data to establish a trend on plankton populations, it is expected that unabated global warming will reduce the amount of ocean plankton in the 21st century, reducing the carrying capacity of all other life [^{ 3 }].

## Whaling

The commercial hunting of whales has decreased dramatically since the 1960s, but has ticked up in recent years.

Major reasons for the decline include the establishment of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling in 1946 [^6] and the International Whaling Commission's 1986 on commercial whaling [^7]. Following the IWC's Florian√≥polis Declaration in 2018, Japan withdrew from the IWC and announced a resumption of commercial whaling, which they had previously been conducting under the guise of scientific research [^8].

Most commercial whaling today is conducted for whale meat [^9]. Historically, whaling was also done for whale oil and spermiceti for lighting, baleen (whalebone) to stiffen corsets and other fashion uses, and ambergris for perfumes. These uses have now mostly disappeared [^10].

## Biodiversity and Carbon Content
A restored marine ecosystem will sequester carbon, countering the effects of climate change. The possible amount sequestered is not well understood [^{ 2 }]. The potential for seaweed growth has been estimated at 0.6 billion tons of carbon [^{ 1 }], or the equivalent of about 1.7 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, about 4% of annual world emissions today.

Ecosystem restoration could be done by removing the negative pressures on marine ecosystems, including plastic pollution and bottom trawling [^{ 2 }].
