## Biodiversity Status

As on land, biodiversity in the oceans is threatened.

Biodiversity ultimately depends on primary producers, which in the ocean is mainly plankton. While there is not yet strong enough data to establish a trend on plankton populations, it is expected that unabated global warming will reduce the amount of ocean plankton in the 21st century, reducing the carrying capacity of all other life [^{ 3 }].

## Biodiversity and Carbon Content
A restored marine ecosystem will sequester carbon, countering the effects of climate change. The possible amount sequestered is not well understood [^{ 2 }]. The potential for seaweed growth has been estimated at 0.6 billion tons of carbon [^{ 1 }], or the equivalent of about 1.7 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, about 4% of annual world emissions today.

Ecosystem restoration could be done by removing the negative pressures on marine ecosystems, including plastic pollution and bottom trawling [^{ 2 }].
