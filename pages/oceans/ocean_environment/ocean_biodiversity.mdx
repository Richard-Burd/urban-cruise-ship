## Biodiversity and Carbon Content
A restored marine ecosystem will sequester carbon, countering the effects of climate change. The possible amount sequesterd is not well understood [^{ 2 }]. The potential for seaweed growth has been estimated at 0.6 billion tons of carbon [^{ 1 }], or the equivalent of about 1.7 billion tons of CO2, about 4% of annual world emissions today.

Ecosystem restoration could be done by removing the negative pressures on marine ecosystems, including plastic pollution and bottom trawling [^{ 2 }].
