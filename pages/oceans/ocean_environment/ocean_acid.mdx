# Ocean Acidification
Uptake of carbon is the main cause of ocean acidification, or the long-term trend of falling ocean pH. Ocean acidification poses a threat to marine ecosystems.

Ocean acidification has negative impacts of fisheries, the ocean as a carbon sink, and the tourism, scentific, and cultural value of biodiversity [^{ 2 } ]. Losses has been estimated to reach $1 trillion per year by 2100 under projected CO2 emissions [^{ 3 } ].
