# Resources

## Uranium
Seawater contains 3.3 parts per billion of dissolved seawater--though diffuse, this resource is about 4 trillion kilograms or 1000 times more than the uranium reserves in terresterial mines [^{ 31 } ]. Recent cost estimates are that uranium from seawater, translated into electricity cost, would cost 1.25 cents/kWh [^ { 32 } ]. Ongoing research, particular into better material for adsorbents, is hoped to bring the cost of seawater uranium recovery to the current spot price of uranium [^ { 33 } ],[^ { 34 } ]. Seawater uranium extraction has been demonstrated on a small scale [^ { 35 } ].

To harvest enough uranium for a 1 GW nuclear power plant, it is necessary to process 160 km<sup>3</sup> of seawater per year [^ { 36 } ]. It is proposed to attach harvesters to the base structures of offshore wind turbines [^ { 36 } ]. Although the brine produced from desalination plants could offer greater concentrations, no desalination plant is large enough to allow production of uranium at a needed scale [^ { 36 } ].

There are two rationales for moving heavy manufacturing to the deep sea: to take advantage of possible low-cost ocean energy, and to move pollution far from people.
