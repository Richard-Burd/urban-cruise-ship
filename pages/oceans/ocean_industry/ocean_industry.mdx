# Manufacturing

There are two rationales for moving heavy manufacturing to the deep sea: to take advantage of possible low-cost ocean energy, and to move pollution far from people.

## Industry Concepts
When offshore oil rigs reach the end of their oil production, they can be appropriated for other uses, creating an offshore industrial space at low marginal cost. In an environmental impact statement, the Minerals Management Services of the U. S. Department of the Interior identified ocean energy production, aquaculture, and research and monitoring as among industrial uses for old oil rigs [7].

Large ships can also be appropriated for energy production and manufacturing.

## Energy
Access to abundant, low-cost energy is a major factor in the success of energy-intensive industries [1]. Iceland is a leader in aluminum smelting [6] and metal smelting in general [5], for instance, in major part due to cheap geothermal power and hydroelectricity. Australia is developing an ammonia export terminal because local solar energy is cheap and exceeds local needs [4].

The potential of wave energy is greatest in the deep ocean, particularly in the Southern hemisphere [3][11], and of ocean thermal energy near the equator [9].
