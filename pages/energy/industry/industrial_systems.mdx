# Industrial Systems

Within world industry, about 49% of onsite energy is lost to waste and inefficiency [^4]. Systemic changes in the structure of manufacturing plants can reduce these losses.

## Benchmarking
Benchmarking is the practice of measuring the energy performance of plants across an industry and setting the best performing plants as a standard. As of 2010, there is an estimated potential of 23-31 exajoules of energy savings through benchmarking, mostly in low-income countries [^22].

Benchmarking programs such as the Superior Energy Performance (SEP) can show financial payback times of less than two years [^14].

## Motor and Steam Systems
Motor systems use 10,700 TWh of electricity each year, of which 5700 TWh are used by industrial motors [^21]. Their efficiency will increase by an estimated 14% by 2040 under business as usual, or by 35% under accelerated efficiency policies [^9].

There is an estimated savings potential of 8.8 exajoules per year from steam system energy based on 2005 usage [^4]. These savings can be realized at a cost of 1.4 to 14.4 Â¢/kWh [^11].

## Combined Heat and Power
Conventional thermal power systems waste much heat and operate with an efficiency of about 45%, whereas a combined heat and power (CHP) system generates electricity and captures exhaust heat for direct use. The combined system operates with efficiencies of 65-75% [^20], up to 89% [^8]. We estimate a technical potential of about 75 GW additional CHP capacity in the United States [^19], of which about half should be economically viable [^7].

Conversely, high temperature waste heat from industrial processes can be recovered for electricity production. The United States has a technical potential of 8,840 MW from waste heat to power (WHP) systems, of which 2,904 MW should be accepted by the market [^3].
