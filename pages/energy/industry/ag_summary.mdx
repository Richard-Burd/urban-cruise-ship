# Food and Water

See also our [Matter analysis](/matter) for more information on food and water. Here we focus on summarizing potential energy savings.

## Agriculture
World agriculture is the most important driver of human land and water use, as well as a major factor in [climate change](/habitat/environment/climate_socio).

#### World agriculture's [contribution](/matter/ag_env/ag_landuse) to land use, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and water withdrawals. See also the impacts of the larger food preparation and distribution [system](/matter/ag_dist).

The greatest opportunity for reducing impacts of agriculture is in switching to [plant-based diets](/matter/practices/meat), or at least in reducing consumption of beef and mutton. Lesser savings are possible through expanding use of [no-till farming](/matter/practices/conservation_ag), [genetic modification](/matter/practices/gmo), and [precision farming](/matter/practices/precision), though these trends are driven largely by economics. [Organic farming](/matter/practices/organic_ag) generally saves energy at the cost of more land, while forms of intensive farming, such as [greenhouses](/matter/practices/indoor) and [power-to-food](/matter/practices/synthetic_ag), save land at the cost of energy. Additional modest savings are possible through reducing [food waste, overeating](/matter/ag_dist/food_waste), and [localized food production](/matter/ag_dist/ag_dist_overall), though it is unclear how much food waste can be reduced, and local foods have drawbacks from food being grown in suboptimal climates.

#### Additional options for agriculture include [novel animal feeds](/matter/practices/meat) and [aquaculture](/oceans/ocean_industry/seafood) and expanded use of [hydroponics, vertical farming](/matter/practices/indoor), and [algaculture](/matter/practices/synthetic_ag).

## Water
Most of the world's water use is for agriculture, with thermal power a major secondary use.

In the United States, where power generation is a larger share of water withdrawal, the following savings opportunities are observed.

While [plant-based diets](/matter/practices/meat), [drip irrigation, dry cooling and non-thermal power, and efficiency in cities and industry](/matter/water/water_usage) can reduce water needs, pressure on fresh water supplies can also be relieved by [supplying water](/matter/water/water_provision) though waste water recycling and, as a backstop, desalination.
