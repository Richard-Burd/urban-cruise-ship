# Food and Water

See also our [Matter analysis](http://urbancruiseship.org/site/foodwater) for more information on food and water. Here we focus on summarizing potential energy savings.

## Agriculture
World agriculture is the most important driver of human land and water use, as well as a major factor in [climate change](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/climate).

#### World agriculture's [contribution](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/ag_landuse) to land use, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and water withdrawals. See also the impacts of the larger food preparation and distribution [system](http://urbancruiseship.org/topic/foodwater/ag_dist).

The greatest opportunity for reducing impacts of agriculture is in switching to [plant-based diets](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/meat), or at least in reducing consumption of beef and mutton. Lesser savings are possible through expanding use of [no-till farming](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/conservation_ag), [genetic modification](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/gmo), and [precision farming](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/precision), though these trends are driven largely by economics. [Organic farming](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/organic_ag) generally saves energy at the cost of more land, while forms of intensive farming, such as [greenhouses](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/indoor) and [power-to-food](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/synthetic_ag), save land at the cost of energy. Additional modest savings are possible through reducing [food waste, overeating](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/food_waste), and [localized food production](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/ag_dist_overall), though it is unclear how much food waste can be reduced, and local foods can have drawbacks from being grown in suboptimal climates.

#### Additional options for agriculture include [novel animal feeds](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/meat) and [aquaculture](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/seafood) and expanded use of [hydroponics, vertical farming](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/indoor), and [algaculture](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/synthetic_ag).

## Water
Most of the world's water use is for agriculture, with thermal power a major secondary use.

In the United States, where power generation is a larger share of water withdrawal, the following savings opportunities are observed.

While [plant-based diets](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/meat), [drip irrigation, dry cooling and non-thermal power, and efficiency in cities and industry](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/water_usage) can reduce water needs, pressure on fresh water supplies can also be relieved by [supplying water](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/water_provision) though waste water recycling and, as a backstop, desalination.
