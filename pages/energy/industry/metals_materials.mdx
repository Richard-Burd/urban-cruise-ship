# Metals and Materials

In this section, we look at greenhouse gas emissions and energy use associated with metal production. See also our [broader analysis](/matter/mining) of mining and minerals.

## Emissions
More elements of the periodic table are becoming critical to modern industrial production, and this is likely to become even more true as renewable energy and electric vehicles become more prevalent [^7].

#### Sources: Energy and emissions figures from [^7]. For most elements, total tonnage from is [^6], with additional data from [^1], [^2], [^4], [^5], [^8], [^9], and [^10] as indicated.

It is estimated that about 49 EJ of primary energy and 3.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide eissions, about 10% of the world total in both categories, are dedicated to primary element production [^7].

## Energy Use
Energy is a substantial share of the cost of mining and refining metals. For this reason, a shock in energy prices propagates through other commodities, such as metals, and causes price rises there too.
