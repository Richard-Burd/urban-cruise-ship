# Carbon Capture and Sequestration

A carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS) system is designed to remove CO₂ at the source of emission, such as a coal or natural gas plant, or from the environment. The CO₂ can be stored in a sealed underground chamber or used for another purpose. As of July 2024, there are 50 CCS projects in the world with a collection capture capacity of 51 million tons of CO₂ per year. An additional 365 million tons of capacity where in various stages of planning and development [^34]. This is up from 40 million tons per year as of 2018 [^8].

For [industrial heat](/energy/industry/industrial_heat) and process emissions from [major commodities](/energy/industry/major_commodities), CCS may be the only economically viable tool to reduce emissions by more than 30% [^21].

## Cost

We estimate the following costs of carbon capture from various industrial sources.

<ArticleImage image={"ccs_abatement_cost.svg"} width={960} height={990} />
#### Costs from industrial sources are given by Folger [^6] and the IEA ([^13] and [^14]). Costs from coal power are estimated by Gillingham and Stock [^7], Hardisty et al. [^9], Hu and Zhai [^10], and Rubin et al. [^22]. Costs from natural gas are estimated by Budinis et al. [^2] and Rubin et al. [^22]. Fasihi et al. [^5] estimate the cost from direct air capture. The IPCC [^15] estimates the cost from bioenergy and carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS).

Seawater may also be a promising venue for extracting carbon dioxide [^24], though reliable potential costs estimates are limited. Recent analysis suggests that the CO₂ abatement cost of synthetic diesel from seawater may range from $373 to $717 per ton [^4].

A major determinant in the monetary and energy costs of CO₂ capture is concentration, with lower costs from higher concentrations. The following are estimates of primary energy requirements to capture a ton of CO₂ from various sources.

## Sources of Carbon

While industrial sources of carbon tend to be cheaper than diffuse sources such as direct air capture, only limited amounts of them are available, and fossil fuel-based sources in particular will hopefully be phased out eventually. Following are estimates of how much carbon will be available at midcentury from non-fossil sources.

## Usage

Most captured CO₂ today is used for enhanced oil recovery, with most of the remainder stored geologically.

<ArticleImage image={"ccs_usage.svg"} width={730} height={190} />
#### Destination of captured CO<sub>2</sub> as of 2018. Source: Global CCS Institute [^8]. As of 2023, roughly the same percentage of captured CO<sub>2</sub>--79%--was used for enhanced oil recovery, though the majority of projects planned to 2030 as of 2023 were for dedicated storage [^40].

A barrel of oil releases about 500 kg of CO₂, and if CO₂ enhanced oil recovery is used, about 300-600 kg CO₂ are injected into the well [^19].

For the industrial CO<sub>2</sub> market more broadly, the dominant uses are urea for fertilizer and enhanced oil recovery. The world market of 230 million tons of industrial CO<sub>2</sub> is less than 1% of world emissions of about 40 billion tons annually as of 2022.

<ArticleImage image={"co2_reuse.svg"} width={660} height={330} />
#### Source: IEA [^25].

Potential future uses of captured CO₂ include [methanol](/energy/energy_distribution/methanol), [hydrocarbons](/energy/energy_distribution/synfuels), [methane](/energy/energy_distribution/methane), mineralization into building materials, working fluids for [coal](/energy/energy_production/coal) and [geothermal](/energy/energy_production/geothermal) power plants, fertilizing plant growth in [greenhouses](/matter/practices/indoor) [^1], feedstock for the chemical industry, and several niche industrial uses [^11], [^17].

If CO₂ is captured from fossil fuels or cement, and then used to produce synthetic fuels, the overall process may have lower emissions than the conventional alternative, but it is not a true low-carbon process. Rather, in this scenario, each molecule of CO₂ is emitted over two processes rather than one.

### Enhanced Oil Recovery

Enhanced oil recovery, also known as enhanced oil extraction or tertiary recovery, is a means of injecting heat, chemicals, or a high pressure gas, often carbon dioxide, into an oil well to increase production. Applied after primary (without additional injection) and secondary (water flooding), EOR works by mixing the injected fluid with the oil, thereby increasing the ease of recovery [^26]. The sources of injection for EOR are estimated as follows.

#### World EOR projects by type, as of 2017. Percentages do not add to 100% due to rounding. Source: International Energy Agency [^29].

As of 2019, it was estimated that 70% of CO<sub>2</sub> for EOR was sourced from natural geologic deposits. Such EOR provides no carbon sequestration benefit [^31]. When CO<sub>2</sub> is captured from an industrial source, it is important to credit the carbon savings to either the source of capture, or to the oil well, but not to both [^31].

As of 2018, about 2% of oil was produced via EOR, and lower prices and competition with other emerging production technologies had diminished interest in EOR [^30]. The International Energy Agency has estimated that EOR has the potential to sequester 60-240 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub> from 2015 to 2050, or 1.7 to 6.9 billion tons per year over that period [^27]. If the source of CO<sub>2</sub> is from the atmosphere or from another industrial process, then each captured ton of CO<sub>2</sub> used for EOR will reduce emissions on net by 0.63 to 0.79 tons, taking into account leakage and the effect of increased oil consumption overall [^27].

The leakage rate of carbon dioxide injected into oil wells has been estimated at less than 1% over 1000 years [^26], but this requires that the well is properly sealed after production has ceased [^32]. Induced seismicity has been observed as a result of EOR, though this can be managed by controlling the rate of injection [^33].

## Direct Air Capture

Direct air capture (DAC) refers to a system that captures and removes carbon dioxide from the ambient atmosphere, rather than a concentrated industrial waste stream. The International Energy envisions that DAC will remove 980 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year by 2050, compared to just 0.01 million tons per year as of 2022 [^12]. The two leading technologies are liquid solvent DAC (L-DAC) and solid sorbent DAC (S-DAC). Following are estimates of the resources required for 1 billion tons of DAC per year, about 2.5% of current emissions.

<div className="table-wrapper">

| Resource                            | 1 billion tons L-DAC     | 1 billion tons S-DAC | Present annual consumption           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Land Use                            | 400 km²                  | 1200-1700 km²        | 149 million km² (Earth's land area)  |
| Water                               | 50 billion tons          | 0.2-2 billion tons   | 4600 billion tons                    |
| Energy                              | 5.5-8.8 exajoules        | 7.2-9.5 EJ           | 600 EJ                               |
| Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions | 100-400 million tons CO₂ | 30-91 million tons   | 40 billion tons                      |
| Cost                                | Up to $340 billion       | Up to $540 billion   | World GDP about $106 trillion in 2023|

</div>

#### Cost estimates are based on current values and would almost certainly decrease with a large buildout. The IEA projects an eventual cost of less than $100/ton for CO2 removal by DAC. Land use estimates are for the DAC facilities only, and not the energy infrastructure required to fuel them. Source: IEA [^12].

S-DAC can operate with lower temperature heat, enabling it to use geothermal or solar thermal energy. L-DAC requires high temperature heat.

If an L-DAC system had to desalinate its own water usage, it would add $3.50 - $9.50/ton CO₂ to the cost of carbon removal [^12]. It is possible to run a DAC device intermittently on renewable electricity as a load balancing strategy, but this would further raise the cost [^12].

## Geological Storage

It is estimated that the world could store 8,000 to 55,000 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, the equivalent of 200-1275 years of emissions at current rates [^12]. In the United States, it is estimated that over half of onshore storage could be developed at less than $10/ton CO<sub>2</sub>, while more than half of offshore storage could be developed at less than $35/ton [^12]. Carbon leakage is estimated at less than 0.01% per year, slow enough for CCS to be secure as a mitigation solution [^20].

Estimates vary; one holds that the world's technical storage capacity is 16 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year, a bit less than half of current emissions [^41].

## Environmental and Safety Issues

Most modeled scenarios to mitigate the risk of climate change include a role for negative emissions technologies such as direct air capture [^36], but there is a fear that the possibility of expanded use of carbon capture or direct air capture will create a "moral hazard" [^39], whereby there is a reduction of public will for other forms of mitigation. Studies of public opinion [^37] have found a minimal effect of understanding of carbon removal on public will for other mitigation solutions. The moral hazard argument is also based on a false understanding of climate policy as a binary, exclusive choice between removal and mitigation [^38].

Carbon dioxide is mostly safe as an industrial chemical, though above its critical point of about 31°C and a pressure of nearly 73 atmospheres, CO<sub>2</sub> can be explosive if pressure is suddenly lost. The risks of carbon sequestration facilities are similar to those of other industrial facilities, and the risks of CO<sub>2</sub> pipeline transport are similar to those of other pipelines [^35]. See our [analysis](/energy/energy_distribution/ff_transport) of CO<sub>2</sub> and other pipelines for more information.
