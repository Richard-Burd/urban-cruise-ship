# Carbon Capture and Sequestration

A carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS) system is designed to remove CO₂ at the source of emission, such as a coal or natural gas plant, or from the environment. The CO₂ can be stored in a sealed underground chamber or used for another purpose. Currently about 40 million tons of CO₂ are captured each year, about 0.1% of total emissions [^8].

For [industrial heat](/energy/industry/industrial_heat) and process emissions from [major commodities](/energy/industry/major_commodities), CCS may be the only economically viable tool to reduce emissions by more than 30% [^21].

## Cost
We estimate the following costs of carbon capture from various industrial sources.

<ArticleImage image={"ccs_abatement_cost.svg"} width={960} height={990} />
#### Costs from industrial sources are given by Folger [^6] and the IEA ([^13] and [^14]). Costs from coal power are estimated by Gillingham and Stock [^7], Hardisty et al. [^9], Hu and Zhai [^10], and Rubin et al. [^22]. Costs from natural gas are estimated by Budinis et al. [^2] and Rubin et al. [^22]. Fasihi et al. [^5] estimate the cost from direct air capture. The IPCC [^15] estimates the cost from bioenergy and carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS).

Seawater may also be a promising venue for extracting carbon dioxide [^24], though reliable potential costs estimates are limited. Recent analysis suggests that the CO₂ abatement cost of synthetic diesel from seawater may range from $373 to $717 per ton [^4].

A major determinant in the monetary and energy costs of CO₂ capture is concentration, with lower costs from higher concentrations. The following are estimates of primary energy requires to capture a ton of CO₂ from various sources.

#### Sources: Malins [^18] and von der Assen et al. [^23], with primary energy conversion given by the Building Energy Codes Program [^3].

## Sources of Carbon
While industrial sources of carbon tend to be cheaper than diffuse sources such as direct air capture, only limited amounts of them are available, and fossil fuel-based sources in particular will hopefully be phased out eventually. Following are estimates of how much carbon will be available at midcentury from non-fossil sources.

## Usage
Most captured CO₂ today is used for enhanced oil recovery, with most of the remainder stored geologically.

#### Source: Global CCS Institute [^8].

A barrel of oil releases about 500 kg of CO₂, and if CO₂ enhanced oil recovery is used, about 300-600 kg CO₂ are injected into the well [^19].

For the industrial CO<sub>2</sub> market more broadly, the dominant uses are urea for fertilizer and enhanced oil recovery. The world market of 230 million tons of industrial CO<sub>2</sub> is less than 1% of world emissions of about 40 billion tons annually as of 2022.

Potential future uses of captured CO₂ include [methanol](/energy/energy_distribution/methanol), [hydrocarbons](/energy/energy_distribution/synfuels), [methane](/energy/energy_distribution/methane), mineralization into building materials, working fluids for [coal](/energy/energy_production/coal) and [geothermal](/energy/energy_production/geothermal) power plants, fertilizing plant growth in [greenhouses](/matter/practices/indoor) [^1], feedstock for the chemical industry, and several niche industrial uses [^11], [^17].

If CO₂ is captured from fossil fuels or cement, and then used to produce synthetic fuels, the overall process may have lower emissions than the conventional alternative, but it is not a true low-carbon process. Rather, in this scenario, each molecule of CO₂ is emitted over two processes rather than one.

## Direct Air Capture
Direct air capture (DAC) refers to a system that captures and removes carbon dioxide from the ambient atmosphere, rather than a concentrated industrial waste stream. The International Energy envisions that DAC will remove 980 million tons of CO2 per year by 2050, compared to just 0.01 million tons per year now [^12]. The two leading technologies are liquid solvent DAC (L-DAC) and solid sorbent DAC (S-DAC). Following are estimates of the resources required for 1 billion tons of DAC per year, about 2.5% of current emissions.

<div className="table-wrapper">

| Resource | 1 billion tons L-DAC | 1 billion tons S-DAC | Present annual consumption |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Land Use | 400 km² | 1200-1700 km² | 149 million km² (Earth's land area) |
| Water | 50 billion tons | 0.2-2 billion tons | 4600 billion tons |
| Energy | 5.5-8.8 exajoules | 7.2-9.5 EJ | 600 EJ |
| Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions | 100-400 million tons CO₂ | 30-91 million tons | 40 billion tons |
| Cost | Up to $340 billion | Up to $540 billion | World GDP about $85 trillion in 2020 |

</div>

#### Cost estimates are based on current values and would almost certainly decrease with a large buildout. The IEA projects an eventual cost of less than $100/ton for CO2 removal by DAC. Land use estimates are for the DAC facilities only, and not the energy infrastructure required to fuel them. Source: IEA [^12].

S-DAC can operate with lower temperature heat, enabling it to use geothermal or solar thermal energy. L-DAC requires high temperature heat.

If an L-DAC system had to desalinate its own water usage, it would add $3.50 - $9.50/ton CO₂ to the cost of carbon removal [^12]. It is possible to run a DAC device intermittently on renewable electricity as a load balancing strategy, but this would further raise the cost [^12].

## Geological Storage
It is estimated that the world could store 8,000 to 55,000 billion tons of CO2, the equivalent of 200-1275 years of emissions at current rates [^12]. In the United States, it is estimated that over half of onshore storage could be developed at less than $10/ton CO2, while more than half of offshore storage could be developed at less than $35/ton [^12]. Carbon leakage is estimated at less than 0.01%, slow enough for CCS to be secure as a mitigation solution [^20].
