# Industry Overview

Industry is responsible for nearly 40% of energy usage worldwide as follows.

#### Energy use in world industry. Overall figures and figures by sector derived from the IEA Sankey diagrams [^2] and primary energy conversion factors [^1].

Worldwide, we estimate the following potential energy and greenhouse gas savings through various methods in industry.

Reducing carbon dioxide emissions and pollution from industry is a major challenge, both due to the scale of industrial energy and the lack of economical substitutes for fossil fuels in [process heat](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/industrial_heat) and [chemical feedstocks](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/major_commodities). Emissions can be reduced through more aggressive efficiency and technology efforts, such as in commodities and [motor and steam systems](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/industrial_systems), [recycling](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/recycling), and [material reduction](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/material_reduction), but the greatest near term potential might lie in [carbon capture and sequestration](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/ccs). However, CCS necessarily requires policy support, such as carbon pricing or regulation. The solutions with the largest potential impacts--CCS and electricity or hydrogen for [industrial heat](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/industrial_heat)--come at substantial energy costs and will require additional development of clean energy sources.
