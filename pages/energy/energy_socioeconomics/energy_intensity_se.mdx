# Population, Energy, and Emissions
## Population Outlook
Today's world population is approximately 7.7 billion people and growing to a projected 9.6-10.9 billion in 2100.

Recent trends suggest, however, that the UN may be underestimating future population growth in Africa [^6]. See our [additional analysis](/habitat/wellbeing) of world population.

## Future Energy Demand
The arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic had significant effect on energy demand.

The decline in energy demand may be temporary.

## Energy Demand under Population Scenarios

World energy, both overall and on a per capta basis, has grown significantly over the last few decades.

#### Energy trends derived from BP [^2] and population trends from the UN [^19].

To estimate future energy demand, using the median UN population estimate, we consider what will happen if overall energy demand stays fixed, if per capita energy consumption stays fixed, if per capita energy consumption continues to grow linearly as it did from 1965-2014, if the average person in the future consumes like the average German today, and if the average person in the future consumes like the average American today.

#### Energy trends derived from BP [^2] and population trends from the UN [^19].

In the following, we examine the top eight energy-consuming countries in 2014, together with Africa. If the average UN population estimate holds in 2050 and the 1987-2017 trend in per capita energy consumption holds, the following energy consumption in 2050 is expected.

## Economic Energy Efficiency
In 2018, world GDP was estimated at about $121 trillion on a purchasing-power-parity (PPP) (2011 dollars) [^4], [^20]. The economic energy efficiency of the world economy is the monetary output per unit energy, and this figure was over $200 per gigajoule in 2018. It has increased by over 50% since 1990, indicating both that more economic activity is generated for each unit of energy, and that efficiency is improving over time.

#### World energy intensity. Derived from BP [^3] and the World Bank [^20].

The world economy may triple from 2015 to 2050 [^7]. If the 1990-2018 average annual percentage increase in efficiency continues to 2050, then the world's energy will generate $312 per GJ, but the world energy demand will be 987 exajoules, nearly 70% more than today's value.

#### Forecast GDP, energy demand, and energy efficiency to 2050. GDP figures are given by Pricewaterhouse Coopers [^7] and energy figures from BP [^3] and the World Bank [^20].

Economic energy efficiency varies by country. The following shows efficiency for selected countries in 1990 and in 2018, using PPP.

<ArticleImage image={"Energy Intensity by Country.svg"} width={680} height={680} />
#### Evolution in energy intensity by country. Derived from BP [^3] and the World Bank [^20].

Economic energy efficiency is driven by several factors: technical efficiency, the design of cities, climate, personal behavior, and the composition of the economy [^17]. For individual countries, trade of energy-intensive products can affect observed efficiency [^12]. Some of the observed improvement in energy efficiency is the result of switching to higher quality fuels [^9], [^14]. In general, the efficiency metric covers many factors that are unrelated to technical energy efficiency [^16].

The above figures measure economic energy efficiency by considering modern forms of energy. The historical pattern is that efficiency tends to rise as a country industrializes, and after that it falls [^15]. However, if the energy inherent in biomass (e.g. crops, firewood) is also included, then the pattern is that energy intensity falls even in the early stages of industrialization [^1], [^15].

## Kaya Metrics
Environmental impacts can be understood as the result of several forces: rising population and wealth tend to increase impacts, while improved technology decreases impacts. The IPAT (Impact = Population × Affluence × Technology) formula quantifies these three tendencies [^5]. Relatedly, greenhouse gas emissions from energy can be expressed with the Kaya identity: Emissions = Population × Affluence × Energy Intensity × Greenhouse Gas Intensity of Emissions [^10]. World trends since 1990 are as follows.

<ArticleImage image={"kaya.svg"} width={700} height={450} />
#### Kaya decomposition of world greenhouse gas emissions from energy from 1990 to 2018. Population figures are from the UN [^18]. World GDP figures are taken on a purchasing power parity basis and derived from the World Bank [^21]. Energy is taken as primary energy and reported from BP [^3]. Only greenhouse gas emissions from energy are considered, and emissions are also taken from BP. All times series are scaled so as to have a value of 1 in 1990.

Compared to the world, the United States has seen slower population and GDP growth and faster improvements to energy intensity and carbon intensity of energy. As a result, US emissions appear to have peaked in 2007 and are close to 1990 levels.

Some of the observed improvement in intensity is the result of switching to higher quality fuels [^9], [^14].

On a world basis, factors other than energy intensity become somewhat less important than on a national basis.
