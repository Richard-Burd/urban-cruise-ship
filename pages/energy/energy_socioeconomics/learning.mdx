# Learning by Doing

The cost of a product tends to fall as more is produced. The effect, identified by Wright [^22] in the context of aircraft, can be quantified and modeled. Cost reduction through production is an essential element of bringing a clean energy technology to commercial maturity. Following are observed learning rates for select technologies. The learning rate is the percent cost reduction that is observed for doubling cumulative production.

Not all of the cost decline observed for a growing technology is necessarily a result of learning curves. Some of the decline may be the result of other technological improvements that would occur regardless of how much the technology is deployed [^17].
