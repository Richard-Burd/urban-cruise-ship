# Outlook
## Energy

World energy production is expected to continue to increased to midcentury, though possibly at a slower rate than the historical norm.

## Electricity

Based on past trends, we project the following development of electricity generation. Growth may be driven in part by electrification, or the use of electricity for the provision of energy that was previously not supplied by electricity.

In 2022, Resources for the Future [^17] summarized the projections of several major energy scenarios. A brief overview of their conclusions is as follows.

<ArticleImage image={"projection_summary.svg"} width={750} height={550} />
#### The scenarios, detailed below, can be divided into four categories. "Reference" scenarios assume no additional effort at greenhouse gas mitigation. "Evolving Policy" scenarios assume some additional policy effort but no specific warming target. The "1.5°C Warming Scenario" and "2°C Warming Scenario" are crafted to roughly achieve a total warming target.

World primary energy consumption is expected to grow through at least midcentury except under some aggressive climate change mitigation scenarios. Fossil fuel usage may decline, but it is not expected to disappear even under aggressive mitigation. Renewable energy is expected to continue growing strongly.

Electricity is expected to grow, both in absolute terms and as a share of total energy, in most scenarios as more energy usages are electrified. Fossil fuels are expected to disappear from electricity production only under aggressive decarbonization. Wind and solar power are expected to grow significantly, and renewables used less widely today, such as geothermal and wave, might also become significant.

Without concerted decarbonization effort, world emissions may continue to increase to 2050.

Carbon capture and sequestration might play a much larger role, allowing continued burning of fossil fuels with fewer emissions.

The scenarios considered are as follows.
