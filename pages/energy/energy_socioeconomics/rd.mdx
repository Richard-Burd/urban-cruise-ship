# Research and Development
Research and development refers to a deliberate investment of effort, whether by a government or a private organization, to bring a technology to commercial production. R&D activities can range from basic research to commercializing a product to improving a product that has already been commercialized.

## R&D Priorities
We recommend that public agencies, such as the U. S. Department of Energy, undertake research and development as follows. Details are in our assessments of [individual energy production technologies](/energy/energy_production).

<ArticleImage image={"electricity_rd.svg"} width={750} height={500} />
#### Expected costs and benefits for electricity R&D, in billions of dollars.

#### See the individual production analyses ([solar](/energy/energy_production/solar), [wind](/energy/energy_production/wind), [nuclear](/energy/energy_production/nuclear), [fusion](/energy/energy_production/fusion), and [ocean](/energy/energy_production/mhk) power) for information on potential cost and market share, and our [Environmental Impacts of Energy](/energy/energy_production/energy_env) analysis for information about GHG and non-GHG impacts.

#### For R&D time, we assume 5 years for technologies that are commercially deployed today but not at full potential, 10 years for those near but not at commercialization, 25 years for those not near commercialization, and 40 years for fusion and space-based solar.

#### For R&D cost, we assume $460 million per year for nuclear technologies, based on an analysis of advanced reactors [^4]; $830 million per year for renewables, based on a wave energy analysis [^10]; and $65 billion total for fusion and space-based solar, based on an analysis of ITER [^8].

#### A 7% discount rate is used throughout.

Our model for the effectiveness of public R&D is as follows. We model that, after the R&D period, an electricity gains 2% of its potential market share every year for 50 years. The market share is based on what a mature form of the technology could undercut by the levelized cost of electricity. The financial benefits of displacing more expensive electricity, greenhouse gas reduction (valued at $50/ton), and non-GHG external benefits of electricity are assessed.

Current production is assessed at 2022 levels from the Energy Institute Statistical Review of World Energy [^r2], except production of Geothermal power is taken from the International Renewable Energy Agency (2021 value) [^r7]. The levelized cost of other forms of electricity are derived from the U.S. Energy Information Administration [^r4], and lifecycle greenhouse gases for existing power plants is taken from Roser [^r5]. For non-greenhouse gas external costs of power, see our discussions of other energy sources.

Our model incorporates an overall rise in electricity demand, as forecast by Enerdata [^r8], and a decrease of carbon-intensity of electricity, as also forecast by Enerdata [^r9]. We assume a 11% chance of an R&D program being successful, based on experience in the pharmaceutical industry [^r6].

## Current Investment
Research and development is necessary to bring new energy technologies to commercial production, which in turn are necessary for a complete transition away from fossil fuels. Worldwide, corporations spend on energy R&D as follows.

There is social benefit to research and development; when one company develops a new product, it does not capture all the benefits as the product spreads to other companies. Thus, even in the presence of an economy-wide carbon price, there is justification for governments to invest in R&D [^9]. Current public investment is as follows.

#### Government investment by International Energy Agency member countries in 2018. Source: IEA [^5]. IEA member countries are responsible for about three quarters of all worldwide public energy R&D spending [^6]. Spending includes direct expenditures as well as subsidies for private R&D.

## Value of R&D
Evidence suggests that research and development carries a large social benefit.

#### The scenarios portrayed above represent different assumptions of the value of R&D and the cost. Source: [^7]. See also Matt Clancy's exposition of the work [^3].

Evidence from small business grants [^2] also suggest that these are highly cost-effective research and development tools. R&D carries significant spillover effects, in that when R&D is funded in one field, it can advance progress in another [^1].
