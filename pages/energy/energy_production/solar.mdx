# Solar Power

We recommend [research and development](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/rd) programs into concentrated solar, advanced solar cells, and luminescent solar concentrators, but not space-based solar power. These solutions are detailed below.

## Costs
While there are outliers, utility-scale solar photovoltaics typically produce power at a competitive 4-6 ¢/kWh. Solar PV technologies that are still under development, such as organic PV and perovskites, may achieve this range as well.

<ArticleImage image={"Cost of Solar Power.jpg"} width={100} height={100} />
#### Estimates of mainstream PV technology from the Electric Power Research Institute [^9], International Renewable Energy Agency [^20], Kost et al. [^23], Lazard [^27], Logan et al. [^28], OpenEI[^36], EIA [^50]. Projected costs from perovskite and organic PVs are given by Cai et al. [^7] and Guo and Min [^14] respectively.

Following are estimated costs of concentrated solar power, distributed solar, and several emerging and speculative non-PV technologies.

#### For concentrated solar power, see the Electric Power Research Institute [^9], International Renewable Energy Agency [^20], Lazard [^27], Logan et al. [^28], OpenEI [^36], EIA [^50], World Energy Council[^53]. For distributed PV, see EPRI [^9], Guo et al. [^15], Kost et al. [^23], and Lazard [^27]. For concentrated PV, see Phillips et al. [^38]. For solar updraft towers, see Schlaich Bergermann Solar GmbH [^44] and Zhu et al. [^54]. For space-based solar, see Mankins [^30].
