# Oil

Oil remains the single largest component of the world's energy supply and is hence critical to the world's economy. It is unlikely that a peak in world oil production will occur soon, but growing reliance on unconventional oil, such as heavy oil, tar sands, and tight oil (oil that is in low-permeability formations and is thus difficult to extract), might raise prices in the long term [^19].

## Uses of Crude oil
Crude oil is refined primarily into transportation fuel, with motor gasoline the largest component. As of 2017, United States refineries produced the following products.

Other fuel usages include hydrocarbon gas liquids, petroleum coke, and still gas. Petrochemicals include plastics and various other chemicals.

## Refining

Crude oil, as harvested from a well, is not in a form that is usable for end purposes; it must first be processed in a refinery into gasoline, diesel, petrochemical feedstocks, and other products. Refining has a typical efficiency of 90.1-90.8%, which means that about 10% of the crude oil's energy content is consumed in the refining process [^r2]. Additionally, a refinery requires 0.0034 joules of electricity for every joule of refined product it produces [^r1], in turn requiring about 0.008-0.009 joules of fossil fuels if the electricity is fossil-generated.

## Pollution
Pollution damages from gasoline are estimated as follows.

#### Non-climate air pollution damages associated with gasoline combustion in light-duty vehicles are estimated at about 33¢ per gallon of gasoline [^5], assuming the gasoline is refined from conventional oil, while the damage from greenhouse gas emissions is about 61¢ per gallon if emissions are valued at $50/ton CO2-equivalent [^7], [^18]. As of June 25, 2019, according to the American Automobile Association [^1], the average retail gasoline price in the United States is $2.67 per gallon.

## Oil Spills
Despite an increase in oil production over the last 50 years, the average annual spillage from tanker traffic is generally going down.

#### Average annual tonnage of oil spilled, presented by decade. 2020s data includes 2020 and 2021. Source: International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation [^9] via Our World in Data [^14].

The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, passed in the wake of the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989, requires responsibility parties to clean oil spills and establishes the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) when responsibility parties cannot do so. Excluding some large events, the average settlement from the OSLTF is about $985 per barrel of oil spilled in the U.S. [^6]. From this figure, and considering all tanker oil spills from 2010 to 2021 and the Deep Water Horizon disaster [^12], unfunded clean-up costs amount to about 1 cent per barrel [^16].

## Flaring

Oil is typically pumped with associated natural gas. When that gas cannot be sold or used on site, it is typically flared. While gas flaring is more environmentally benign than mere venting, flaring comes with environmental costs and is a waste of what could be a valuable resource. The rate of flaring decreased in the 2000s and has been stagnant since.

#### Source: International Energy Agency [^f1].

A total of 144 billion cubic meters of gas was flared in 2021, or about 3.5% of total natural gas production [^f2], with a value of $55 billion [^f1]. Worldwide, greenhouse gas emissions from flaring, including CO<sub>2</sub> released from combustion and methane leakage, were about 400 million tons in 2021, or about 1% of total greenhouse gas emissions [^f2]. Other emissions from flaring include benzene, particulates, nitrogen oxides, heavy metals, black carbon, and carbon monoxide, and are linked to respiratory problems [^f3] and low birth weights [^f4].

## Unconventional Oil
As conventional oil supplies become strained, there is growing development of unconventional alternatives. The three main forms of unconventional oil are light tight oil (LTO), oil shale, and oil sands, though coal-to-liquids, gas-to-liquids, and biofuels are also potential conventional oil alternatives.

About 8% of the world's liquid fuels today come from unconventional sources, led by LTO in the United States, and this share expected to continue to increase [^10]. Following are estimated breakeven costs for various forms of conventional and unconventional oil production.

#### Sources: Kapustin and Grushevenko [^10].

Unconventional oil generally has higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil. The following shows the greenhouse gas emissions from a gallon of gasoline produced from different oil sources.

Oil sands and oil shale have greater water requirements per barrel than conventional oil.

## Oil Power Plants
The levelized cost of electricity from petroleum power plants is estimated at around 16-18 ¢/kWh [^3], [^15]. Petroleum accounts for about 3% of world electricity generation [^8], and oil plants are generally being phased out due to high cost. The externalized cost of oil power plants has been estimated from 0.03 to 39.93 ¢/kWh, with an average of 13.57 ¢ [^2].

## Abiogenic Oil Theory

Abiogenic oil theory is the theory that most petroleum on Earth is created through non-biological process in the upper mantle of the Earth, some of which seeps near the surface [^20],[^21]. Abiogenic oil theory generally holds that crude oil is renewable on human-relevant time frames. The theory was popularized in the United States by Thomas Gold [^22]. Most geologists believes that most crude oil is formed through biological processes and that abiogenic oil theory is not well-supported by evidence [^23].
