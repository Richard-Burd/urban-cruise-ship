# Geothermal

Geothermal is the extraction of heat from below the Earth's surface for energy. Hot reservoirs can be used for electricity production, while warm reservoirs can be harvested directly for heat for [industrial processes](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/industrial_heat) or [district heating](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/heating).

We recommend a [research and development](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/rd) program into enhanced geothermal systems, but not into hydrothermal sea vents. These geothermal methods are detailed below, with hydrothermal sea vents discussed in the context of [ocean energy](http://urbancruiseship.org/topic/oceans/ocean_energy).

## Potential Cost
Geothermal power has the following current and future project costs.

The current high costs for enhanced geothermal reflects the fact that it is still an emerging technology, and mature EGS technology has the potential to be competitive with mainstream power generation.

Recovery of valuable minerals from geothermal brine, such as gold, cesium, rubidium, lithium, and silicates, could further improve the economics, though this is not done presently [^13]. Recovery of rare earth elements does not appear to be economically feasible [^27].

## Resource Potential and Environmental Considerations
The following shows potential annual production from several forms of geothermal energy.

#### Sources: Hiriart et al. for hydrothermal [^5], Krewitt et al. [^8] for world geothermal heat and electricity, and NREL [^12] for US enhanced geothermal electricity. Current world geothermal production is given by BP [^3] and the EIA [^24], and current primary energy by BP [^3].

The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal power depends on the technology.

## Enhanced Geothermal
An enhanced geothermal system (EGS) extracts heat from deep within the Earth and in environments that are not naturally porous. Unlike traditional hydrothermal geothermal energy, EGS resources are accessible from almost everywhere on Earth, though at varying cost and difficulty. Medium-grade EGS resources are widespread throughout the Western United States and available in other parts of the country, while low-grade resources are available almost everywhere [^2]. Estimated EGS reserves are 266,000 EJ [^22], over 400 years of world primary energy consumption.

Following are estimates of potential EGS costs. Enhanced geothermal is a particularly attractive option for [low-temperature industrial processes](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/industrial_heat) such as paper processing and biomass drying [^2].

<ArticleImage image={"egs_price.svg"} width={790} height={420} />
#### Electricity is reported by Tester et al. [^22] and assumes a cumulative $1 billion of investment and learning-by-doing improvement. Beckers et al. [^2] report cost estimates for EGS for direct heat. NREL [^12] estimates the cost for district heating, which is higher since not all extracted heat in a district system would be useful [^21].

Even at a higher price, EGS for district heating should be competitive with natural gas prices observed since 2005 [^23]. Further cost reductions may be possible through combined district heating and cooling systems [^17].

EGS technology does not face any obvious technical barrier and is currently undergoing demonstration deployment, notably at Cooper Basin in Australia [^1]. Nevertheless, additional deployment is needed to reduce costs.

In addition, in the United States, permitting requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) can cause significant delay to geothermal projects and may greatly slow the development of enhanced geothermal resources.

## Supervolcano Risk
A supervolcanic eruption, such as threatened at Yellowstone National Park, would be a catastrophic event. Reducing the buildup of heat in a potentially supervolcanic caldera may reduce the risk. This could be done by drilling holes over the top of the magma chamber, drilling holes around the perimeter of a supervolcano, and managing the water supply within a caldera [^26]. The second of these solutions would allow energy production via enhanced geothermal systems [^26]. However, such an approach could take thousands of years to safely cool a caldera, and there remain unknown risks of inducing an eruption and generally the mechanics of how supervolcanoes work [^26].
