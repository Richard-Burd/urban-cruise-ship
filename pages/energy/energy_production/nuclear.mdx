# Nuclear Fission

Nuclear power is the extraction of energy from fission of heavy atomic nuclei, as opposed to [fusion](/energy/energy_production/nuclear). Here we assess the economic and environmental impact of today's nuclear technology and consider the prospects of future forms.

We recommend further [research and development](/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) into advanced reactors and small modular reactors, discussed below.

## Nuclear Economics
The following portrays estimates of the cost of today's nuclear technology and possible future technologies.

<ArticleImage image={"Cost of Nuclear Power.jpg"} width={980} height={830} />
#### Data sources: Abdulla and Azevedo [^1], Bowen [^3], Bustreo [^5], Electric Power Research Institute [^8], Energy Innovation Reform Project [^9], Enter et al. [^10], European Fusion Development Agreement [^11], IEA et al. [^23], Lazard [^24], OpenEI[^30], Rochau [^33], Rosner and Goldberg [^34], Rothwell and Ganda [^35], Rubio and Tricot [^36], EIA [^41]. Contemporary new nuclear construction tends to be expensive relative to other options, though depreciated nuclear--keeping existing plants open--costs an estimated 2.8 ¢/kWh. Cost estimates for nuclear technologies under development, especially fusion, should be regarded as highly uncertain.

Factors that affect the costs of nuclear power include management issues, safety regulation, and commodity prices [^42]. The long construction times, risk of [cost overruns](http://www.businessinsider.com/americas-new-nuclear-plants-are-costing-billions-more-than-expected-2012-7), and high capital costs make nuclear power especially difficult to finance. Nuclear costs also vary considerably by country.

<ArticleImage image={"nuclear_capital_costs.svg"} width={720} height={320} />
#### Observed capital costs of nuclear power in China, the United States, Japan, Korea, and Europe. Most of the cost of nuclear electricity is capital cost. Sources: IEA [^22] and IEA et al. [^23].

The cost breakdown of a typical nuclear plant is estimated as follows.

<ArticleImage image={"nuclear_plant_cost.svg"} width={730} height={300} />
#### The figures assume a capital cost of $5000/kW (amortized over 50 years at a 7% discount rate and seven year construction time). Sources: World Nuclear Association[^42], [^43].

Under today's conditions, nuclear plants require some form of revenue certainty to be economically competitive [^42]. A capacity market, which would pay operators for dispatchable capacity to insure grid reliability, would also help nuclear economics [^42], but the industry's long-term viability requires cost reduction.

<ReactorStandardizationSolution />

Poltical decentralization--the sepearation of authority across levels of government, such as federal, state, and local governance in the United States--is associated with higher nuclear plant costs [^44].

## Uranium and Thorium Mining
While there is no apparent prospect of a shortage of terrestrial uranium reserves on the horizon, the possibility of recovering uranium from seawater would serve as a backstop against major price increases and insure sufficient supply in the event of an expansion of nuclear power.

<ArticleImage image={"uranium_mining.jpg"} width={1000} height={260} />
#### Cost of providing uranium or thorium (on a uranium-equivalency basis), in per-kilogram and per-kWh generated bases. Sources: thorium data from IAEA [^20], seawater extraction from Parker et al. [^32], uranium price peaks from Frisby [^13], recent uranium prices from TradeTech [^40], and translation of per-kg to per-kWh prices from the World Nuclear Association [^42].

The development of fast breeder reactors, which use uranium fuel much more efficiently, or thorium reactors, could allow an expansion of nuclear power without pressuring reserves [^29]. However, uranium would have to reach a price of about $400/kg for the thorium cycle to be cost-competitive [^20].

## Health, Environmental, and Social Impact
Nuclear power has the following estimated externalized health and environmental costs. See also our analysis of disposal of [nuclear waste](/waste/hazardous_waste/nuclear_waste).

<ArticleImage image={"nuclear_external.svg"} width={700} height={500} />
#### Greenhouse gas emissions are from Schlömer et al. [^38], plant operation from Dones et al. [^7], mining, enrichment, and disposal (non-greenhouse gas) from estimated by the OECD and NEA [^31], and accident risks are quantified by Samadi [^37]. It should be noted that the proper valuation of accident risk is highly contested. Non-accident external costs are generally confirmed by ExternE [^12] and the OECD and NEA [^31]. The mining, enrichment, and disposal costs here are also significantly less than those of Dones et al. [^7].

## Safety

It would be physically impossible for a nuclear power plant, even if deliberately attacked, to explode like an atomic bomb [^s1]. Reactors in the United States use water for cooling, rather than graphite, also making the level of deadly release of radiation as seen in the 1986 Chernobyl disaster extremely unlikely, including in the event of an earthquake or a plane crash [^s1]. There is ongoing risk, not yet realized as of December 2022, that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine could release radiation as a result of the war [^s2].

Experts are divided on the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation that may result from nuclear power. It is difficult, though not impossible, to repurpose civilian enrichment facilities for weapons production [^39]. Historically, states with civilian nuclear programs have not been more likely to develop weapons than those without [^25].

## Small Modular Reactors
Small modular reactors (SMR) are typically defined to have under 300 MW electrical capacity, in contrast to the typical 1000 MW or more of modern nuclear power plants, and they may allow components to be mass-produced and assembled onsite. While SMRs do not offer a clear advantage on cost of electricity, they may reduce construction time, capital risk, and be more attractive for smaller grids [^27]. Through reduced need for backup power supply, improved seismic capability, and large underground pool storage for spent fuel, the risk of the type of failure seen at Fukushima Daiichi would be reduced [^34].

The International Atomic Energy Agency has tracked 55 ongoing SMR projects, of which 19 have the following projected commercialization dates.

## Advanced Nuclear
The nuclear industry is developing a set of new reactor designs which collectively are known as Generation IV. They are expected to be commercially available after 2030. The Generation IV Forum has identified six leading reactor candidates [^17]. The following shows the main rationale [^4], [^14], [^15], [^16], [^19], [^21], current status of research projects [^2], and estimated Technology Readiness Level (TRL) [^18]. The TRL is measured on a scale from 1, indicating a technology that is only at a conceptual stage, to 9, indicating a technology that is commercially deployed in its final form.

<ArticleImage image={"advanced_nuclear.svg"} width={1000} height={1000} />
#### Rationales are given by Brookhaven National Laboratory et al. [^4], the Gen IV International Forum ([^14], [^15], [^16]), and the IAEA ([^19], [^21]); current status reported by the Advanced Reactors Information System [^2]; and Technological Readiness Level estimated by Gouger et al. [^18].

The Breakthrough Institute has identified safety, modularity, thermal efficiency, and technological readiness as the main criteria for reactor designs. They have determined high-temperature gas-cooled reactors--particularly for thermal applications--sodium-cooled and lead-cooled factor reactors, and molten salt reactors as most promising, and gas-cooled fast reactors and supercritical water reactors less promising [^26].

## Revitalizing Nuclear Power

Despite its potential, worldwide and in many wealthy countries, nuclear power has stagnated behind other clean energy sources. There are many reasons for this. They include exaggerated public fears about the dangers of radition release, together with an unrealistic expectation of the improbability of a release, both misconceptions promoted by the nuclear establishment itself; excessive and overly prescriptive regulation; and a lack of innovation in the industry [^45]. Addressing these barriers will be very difficult, but we propose some approaches to doing so as follows.
