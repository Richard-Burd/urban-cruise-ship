# Aviation

## Trends

Worldwide, air travel is increasing rapidly.

## Energy and Emissions

Commercial aviation has improved its energy efficiency over time, and recent mainstream estimates place its energy consumption at 1200-3700 kilojoules per passenger-kilometer. Short flights (under 1000 km) and intercontinental flights tend to be in the same range, per-km.

#### Figures for general air travel are estimated from the Federal Aviation Administration [^5], the IEA [^6], and the National Cooperative Rail Research Program [^11], for short flights (under 1000 km) from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics [^3], Kwan [^10], and Prussi and Lonza [^12], and for intercontinental flights from Abdul et al. [^1], the BTS [^3], and Kwan [^10]. Energy for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) is estimated from Kasliwal et al. [^7] and is assessed for a single passenger over a distance of 75-250 km, with lower per-km energy needs at longer distances. Energy for supersonic flight is estimated from Kharina et al. [^9].

Emerging aviation technologies, such as personal electric vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicles, could increase energy demand. While there are no commercial supersonic flights available today, several companies are working to bring them back for business travelers in the 2020s. They will be significantly more energy-intenstive than comparable subsonic flights. Even more advanced forms of flight, such as hypersonic (at least five times the speed of sound) aircraft [^2] and suborbital aircraft [^13], are under development but far from commercialization.

Long-haul aviation requires fuel with density comparable to kerosene or greater. Barring major aircraft redesign or a technological breakthrough, methanol, ethanol, ammonia, hydrogen, and batteries are unsuitable for aviation except possibly for short distances or for small or personal aircraft [^14]. Low carbon alternatives to petroleum-based jet fuel include biofuels and electrofuels.

The International Energy Agency estimates an energy savings potential in aviation of just under 0.7 exajoules by 2035 through optimization with artificial intelligence [^17].
