# Passenger Rail

Worldwide, rail travel is generally more efficient on a per-km basis than driving or aviation, though less than motorcoach buses. Diesel rail, such as Amtrak, tends to be less efficient, while electric rail, including high speed rail, tends to be more efficient.

Magnetic levitation (maglev) technology remains limited due to high cost. At the same speed, maglev is more efficient than conventional high speed rail due to avoidance of direct contact with the track, but air resistance lowers efficiency at higher speeds. More speculatively, if the Hyperloop system is brought to fruition, its energy needs are unknown but could exceed that of today's rail.

#### Estimates are sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics [^1] and Minn [^6] for diesel rail; Minn [^6] for electric rail; the BTS [^1], EV World [^2], and Minn [^6] for high speed rail; Hoffrichter for hydrogen rail [^4] (with and without regenerative braking), based on the diesel figures and assuming that hydrogen is produced through steam methane reforming of natural gas; EV World [^2], MacKay [^5], and Ziemke [^7] for maglev; and Goeverden et al. [^3] for the Hyperloop.

Hydrogen rail is most advantageous where it is cost-prohibitive to directly electrify tracks [^4].

## Magnetic Levitation

As of 2020, there were six maglev systems operating in the world, with three in China, two in South Korea, and one in Japan [^8], with the only system qualifying as high-speed (top speed of at least 250 kilometers per hour or around 155 miles per hour) the 18.6 mile Shanghai maglev [^9]. The major intercity maglev projects under construction as of 2025 include the Chūō Shinkansen in Japan, which has suffered delays [^10], and the Changsha-Liuyang line in China [^11]. The development of maglev has been slow due to the high cost of the system [^12].
