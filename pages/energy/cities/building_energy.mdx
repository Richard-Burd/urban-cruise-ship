# Energy in Buildings

Buildings use about 20% of energy worldwide and 40% in the United States. Each major category of building energy usage can be reduced through better technology. Overall building energy usage, particularly [heating and cooling](/energy/cities/heating), can be reduced through [density](/cities/cities_land_use/cities_high_density).

## Energy Savings
Wise usage of models of building energy consumption can save significant energy, particularly in areas such as thermal bridging, or areas of high thermal conductivity which can readily cause a building to lose heat or coldness, which are not well-addressed today by building codes.

## How Building Energy is Used
Worldwide, buildings constitute about 20% of world energy consumption in the following way.

#### Source: IEA [^7].

In the United States as of 2015, residential buildings used 21% of total energy, and commercial buildings used 19% [^18]. Commercial buildings include offices, retail, school, hospitals, hotels, churches, warehouses, and public buildings, but not factories. The majority of residential and commercial energy goes to various forms of heating.

#### Energy usage in American residential and commercial buildings. Sources: Residential Energy Consumption Survey [^17] and Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey [^16].

## Household Energy Savings
American households use primary energy as follows and show the following potential for savings.

<ArticleImage image={"housing_energy_savings.svg"} width={1000} height={660} />
#### Sources: Residential Energy Consumption Survey [^17] on current energy by category. Potential savings is estimated as follows: LED lighting from Penning et al. [^12], HVAC and building envelope retrofits from the IEA [^6] and the Rockefeller Foundation and DB Climate Change Advisors [^13], emerging HVAC and cooling technologies from Goetzler et al. [^5], and ongoing applicance efficiency from Boustani et al. [^2]. For LED lighting, since the available data is not specific to residential lighting, overall lighting energy consumtion figures for the residential and commercial sectors, reported by RECS [^17] and CBECS [^16] respectively, are used to apportion the LED savings potential to the residential sector.

## Commercial Energy Savings
Commercial buildings in the United States use 17 EJ of primary energy as of 2012 [^16], broken down by the following categories. We estimate the following potential for energy savings.

#### Overall energy consumption in commercial buildings in the United States and potential for savings. Overall energy is reported by the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey [^16]. Potential savings is estimated as follows: LED lighting from Penning et al. [^12], HVAC and building envelope retrofits from the IEA [^6] and the Rockefeller Foundation and DB Climate Change Advisors [^13], emerging HVAC and cooling technologies from Goetzler et al. [^5], and ongoing applicance efficiency from Boustani et al. [^2]. For LED lighting, since the available data is not specific to commercial lighting, overall lighting energy consumtion figures for the residential and commercial sectors, reported by RECS [^17] and CBECS [^16] respectively, are used to apportion the LED savings potential to the commercial sector.
