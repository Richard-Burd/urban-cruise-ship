# Synthetic Fuels

There are several pathways for producing hydrocarbon fuels from non-petroleum sources, such as electricity. However, we find that electrofuels, or synthetic fuels from electricity, are cost prohibitive at this time.

## Environmental Impacts of Synfuel 

The following compares greenhouse gas emissions from several methods of producing complex hydrocarbons.

<ArticleImage image={"synfuel_ghg.svg"} width={860} height={460} />
#### Sources: Lattanzio [^11], Steele et al. [^18], Tu et al. [^21], EPA [^23]. Electrofuels, also known as power-to-fuel, are hydrocarbons that are produced from electrolyzed hydrogen. For these, the emissions intensity of electricity is taken from Schlömer et al. [^17] and a conversion efficiency of 40-50% is applied, as estimated by Malins [^m7]. No emissions other than those from electricity are assumed, though additional emissions should be attributed if the CO₂ source is from a flue gas and would otherwise be sequestered [^m7]. Carbon capture and sequestration might also reduce emissions from coal- and gas-to-liquids [^10].

Despite the low efficiency of electrofuel production, corn ethanol requires far more land per unit energy.

<ArticleImage image={"synfuel_landuse.svg"} width={850} height={650} />
#### The land use estimate of algal biodiesel is estimated from Atabani et al. [^1]. Yeh et al. [^25] report land use from oil production. Data from Building Energy Codes Program [^4] is used to estimate the primary energy behind electricity, Malins [^m7] gives the conversion efficiency, and Ong et al. [^15] give the land use of solar power. Efficiency on gas-to-liquids is from Steynberg and Dry [^20], and for coal-to-liquids from Höök and Aleklett [^7]. Additional land use estimates are taken from General Electric [^6], Stevens et al. [^19], World Energy Council [^24].

## Environmental Impacts of Synthetic Gas

Following are estimates of the greenhouse gas impacts of three methane production pathways.

<ArticleImage image={"methane_emissions.svg"} width={770} height={250} />
#### Biomethane and natural gas are reported by the Union of Concerned Scientists [^m14], and electromethane, or methane produced from electrolyzed hydrogen, from Malins [^m7]. Electromethane reduces emissions relative to natural gas only if the electricity comes from a low carbon source.

About two megajoules of electricity are needed to create one megajoule of electromethane [^m7].

The environmental benefits of biomethane are greatest when captured methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is prevented from being released into the atmosphere.

## Energy Requirements
As an energy carrier, liquid fuels require more primary energy input to produce than energy they contain. The conversion efficiency of primary energy into usable fuel varies by production method.

<ArticleImage image={"synfuel_primary.svg"} width={730} height={380} />
#### Sources: Höök and Aleklett [^7] for coal-to-liquids and Steynberg and Dry [^20] for gas-to-liquids. The low efficiency of electrofuels stem from two conversion processes: from a primary energy source into electricity, with efficiency about 32% (Building Energy Codes Program [^4]); and then from electricity into hydrocarbons, with efficiency 40-50% (Malins [^m7]).

In cars, electrofuels are a less efficient use of electricity than hydrogen and much less efficient than direct use in an electric vehicle.

<ArticleImage image={"electricity_fuel_eff.svg"} width={570} height={320} />
#### Source: Malins [^m7]. The low efficiency of electrofuels stems from additional losses from the internal combustion engine, which has an efficiency of about 30% in modern cars (fueleconomy.gov [^5]).

## Economics of Synthetic Fuels
With the exception of sugarcane ethanol, most alternatives to petroleum-based gasoline are more expensive and not widely used without policy support.

<ArticleImage image={"synfuel_price.svg"} width={680} height={460} />
#### Sources: Biofuels and Emerging Technologies Team [^2] for gas-to-liquids, Brynolf et al. [^3] for electrofuels, Mantripragada and Rubin [^13] for coal-to-liquids, Moyo et al. [^14] for biofuels, and the EIA [^22] for wholesale gasoline as of June 2019. Electrofuels are especially expensive due to energy losses in the production processes. Prices are highly dependent on the price of feedstock.

The conversion of coal and natural gas into liquid fuels carry heavy greenhouse gas and other environmental costs, and they are not likely to ever be economically attractive options [^8], [^16]. Aside from sugarcane, [biofuels](/energy/energy_production/bio) are also unlikely to be economically sound, and they carry major land use impacts. Electrofuels can be an acceptable option only with a low-cost and low-impact electricity source, and even then their use is likely to be confined to sectors that are difficult to electrify directly, such as aviation and long-distance trucking [^m7].

Carbon abatement costs of electrofuels are as follows.

<ArticleImage image={"synfuel_cost.svg"} width={700} height={220} />
#### Cost of synthetic fuels, with a carbon cost of $50/ton, and estimated carbon abatement cost. A plant size of 50,000 barrels per day is assumed, as per the Industrial Environmental Research Laboratory [^9].

With such high carbon abatement costs, it does not make sense for a private developer to build a synfuel plant.

## Syngas Economics
Due to the current low price of natural gas in the United States, alternative methods of producing methane are not cost competitive.

<ArticleImage image={"methane_price.svg"} width={710} height={310} />
#### Price of methane from several pathways. Sources: Jalalzadeh-Azar [^m5] for biomethane, Malins [^m7] for electromethane, and Nasdaq [^m8] for natural gas as of September 2019.

Following are estimates of the cost and the cost of carbon abatement for two types of synthetic methane plants in the United States. Due to the low price of natural gas, the economics of such plants are very challenging.

<ArticleImage image={"methane_cost.svg"} width={640} height={320} />
#### Cost of biomethane and electromethane plants relative to natural gas and cost of carbon abatement. These calculations are based on a plant that produces 54 billion cubic feet of natural gas each year, as does the Great Plains Synfuels Plant [^m9].

## Biomethane
Biomethane is produced primarily from waste products: wastewater, landfills, manure, and other organic wastes; additional production would be possible from dedicated crops but would be more expensive. World potential is estimated as follows.

<ArticleImage image={"biomethane_potential.svg"} width={730} height={385} />
#### Biomethane production potential, compared to world natural gas. Source: IEA [^m4], with total natural gas production from BP [^m1].

From waste products, the biomethane potential in the United States is almost 8 million tons per year [^m10], less than 1% of total natural gas production [^m13].

<MethaneCaptureFromWasteSolution />

## Coal-to-Gas
There is a single coal-to-gas plant, the Great Plains Synfuels Plant, operating in the United States. In addition to synthetic natural gas, the plant produces CO₂ for enhanced oil recovery and gas-derived products. Although the plant operates profitably, another probably would not be built due to the low cost of natural gas [^m9].

In East Asia, where natural gas is more expensive, gasifiers are of increasing popularity. Coal is most common syngas feedstock, comprising about half of the world's 70 gigawatts (thermal) of syngas capacity as of 2010 [^m15].

## Methane as Shipping Fuel
Liquified natural gas (LNG) comprises a small but growing share of the shipping fuel market [^m2]. LNG eliminates most SOx, NOx, and particulate pollution relative to diesel fuels [^m12], but it may have higher life cycle greenhouse gas emissions.

<ArticleImage image={"lng_emissions.svg"} width={730} height={220} />
#### LNG has higher lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, or at best slightly lower emissions, than more common diesel fuels when methane leakage is taken into account. The [standard scenario](/energy/energy_production/gas) assumes a leakage rate of 1.4%, and the high leakage scenario assumes a rate of 2.3%. Several other studies give somewhat lower emissions for LNG but do not take leakage into account or do so to a smaller degree [^m6]. Source: [^m11].
