# Hydrogen

In this section, we examine the current and potential role of hydrogen in the economy and compare the economic and environmental costs of several methods of producing hydrogen.

We show below that, under common price assumptions, electrolyzed hydrogen is not yet a cost-effective strategy. Other elements of a hydrogen economy, which depend on abundant electrolyzed hydrogen, are thus not cost effective either. This may change in the future.

## Potential Hydrogen Economy
In theory, hydrogen can meet most non-electricity energy end uses and also improve the functioning of the power grid. For some roles, there are few other low-carbon options available, but the high cost of hydrogen and associated infrastructure is a major challenge.

#### Summary of major potential roles for hydrogen in the energy economy. Not every potential role is considered. The following data sources are cited for heating and cooking [^3], fuel cell cars [^19], trucks [^22], planes [^13], cargo ships [^14], [^18], trains [^6], load balancing [^12], steel [^4], industrial heat [^3], and chemicals [^12]. See also our analysis of heat, cars, avaiation and rail, freight, synthetic fuels and methane, energy storage, load balancing, steel, chemicals, ammonia, and methanol.

Hydrogen is only a low carbon solution if it is produced from a low carbon energy source.

The Hydrogen Council envisions $20-25 billion investment per year to produce 78 exajoules of hydrogen per year by 2050 [^9].

## Current Production and Consumption
The world produces about 74 million tons of hydrogen each year [^12], with an energy content of about 9-11 exajoules and financial value of $115 billion [^21], from the following sources.

Today, hydrogen is used primarily for industrial purposes [^11], [^12].

## Cost of Production
The following are estimates the cost of producing hydrogen by several methods.

<ArticleImage image={"lcoh.svg"} width={860} height={520} />
#### Levelized cost of hydrogen, which is the price a hydrogen producer, using the given method, must receive to be profitable. Thermochemical and photochemical production are not commercially mature. For nuclear thermochemical, the projected cost is the average of the projected costs of the sulphur-iodine and copper-chlorine cycles. Sources: steam methane reforming (with and without carbon capture and sequestration), coal (with and without CCS), and electrolysis from the International Energy Agency [^10], solar thermochemical from Hinkey et al. [^7]; solar photochemical from Pinaud et al. [^16]; and other figures from Parkinson et al. [^15].

Electrolyzed hydrogen is, at this time, not cost-effective in general, while carbon capture and sequestration might be if reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is sufficiently valued.

#### Direct financial, CO₂ valued at $50/ton, and other external costs of methods of hydrogen production. We assume a 50,000 kg/day plant, the treshhold between a medium and large plant in Randolph et al. [^17].

## Hydrogen Electrolysis

Hydrogen electrolysis splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen with electricity. Most analysts, including our own work, do not find electrolyzed hydrogen to be cost-effective on a large scale at present, though some analyses [^5] find niche potential for hydrogen produced by low-carbon electricity.

There are several leading electrolysis technologies in use today [^23]. Alkaline electrolyzers, which use a liquid solution electrolyte, are commercially mature, have a comparatively low cost, and long operational life, but they also have slower response times, lower current density, and challenges with intermittent renewable integration. Proton-exchange membrane (or polymer electrolyte membrane) electrolyzers, which use a plastic solid electrolyte, are currently expanding commercially, produce high purity hydrogen, and have fast response times, but are costly due to use of platinum-group metals. Solid oxide electrolyzers, which use a solid ceramic electrolyte, are currently in pilot stage of production, have efficiency sometimes above 90% with heat and electricity, and are good for industrial integration, but they require high operating temperatures (700-1000°C) and pose material degradation concerns. Finally, anion exchange membrane electrolyzers are an emerging technology that have a relatively lower cost and flexible operation but requires ongoing development.

Improving efficiency and declining electrolyzer costs are among the factors that are driving down the cost of electrolyzed hydrogen.

Solid oxide electrolyzer cells are still in the laboratory, but they have the potential to beat aklaline and proton-exchange membrane cells on cost and to have particular applications to producing synthetic fuels [^21].

## Environmental Impacts
Following are estimated greenhouse gas emissions [^15], non-greenhouse gas external costs, and land use requirements for different methods of producing hydrogen.

<ArticleImage image={"hydrogen_impacts.svg"} width={1000} height={670} />
#### Estimated greenhouse gas emissions, as reported by Parkinson et al. [^15], non-greehouse gas external costs, and land use requirements for hydrogen production. For non-GHG externalities and land use, impacts are estimated to be equal to those of [producing electricity](/energy/energy_production/energy_env) from an equal amount of primary energy. Calculations are based on contemporary efficiencies of hydrogen production from input energy sources as reported by the GREET model [^1] and projected efficiency from thermochemical production, as estimated by Schultz [^20].

A 2021 paper [^8] claims that blue hydrogen (steam methane reforming from natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration) has only 18-25% less greenhouse gas emissions than gray hydrogen (SRM without CCS), but these calculations are based on an unusually high amount of [methane leakage](/energy/energy_production/gas) and a 20 year global warming potential, instead of the more common 100 year GWP. When more standard assumptions are used, the GHG impacts of blue and gray hydrogen are close to the values reported above [^2].
