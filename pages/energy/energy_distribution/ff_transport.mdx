# Transportation of Fossil Fuels

In comparing several methods of transporting oil and natural gas, we find that pipelines generally perform better than trucking, shipping, or train transportation.

## Transportion of Oil
For overland transportation of oil, pipelines are generally the safest, cleanest, and cheapest [^2] mode of transportation available.

## Transportation of Natural Gas
The two main methods of transporting natural gas are by pipeline and by shipping in the form of liquified natural gas (LNG). These methods consume energy, as a share of the gas being transported, as follows.
