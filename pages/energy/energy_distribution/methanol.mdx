# Methanol

Methanol--chemically CH₃OH--is a simple alcohol that is used primarily in the production of plastics and other chemicals.

Methanol can be cost-effectively produced with carbon capture and sequestration. The role for clean energy electrolysis is limited now but could expand in the future as the cost of clean energy goes down.

## Current and Potential Status
As of 2019, world production is about 98 millions tons of methanol as follows.

#### Source: [^12].

Most methanol today is produced from fossil fuels, natural gas and coal in particular.

Methanol has the potential to play an important role in the larger energy system.

#### Potential expanded usage of methanol. Data sources for methanol as a transportation fuel [^15] and direct methanol fuel cells for small devices [^16], [^19]. See also our analysis of [fuel density](/energy/energy_distribution/transpo_fuels) and [synthetic fuels](/energy/energy_distribution/synfuels).

## Cost of Production
The most common method of methanol production is steam methane reforming from natural gas [^2]. The following are estimates costs from different feedstocks.

#### Source: IEA [^11], [^12].

The median cost of methanol from natural gas of $280/ton is equivalent to about $1.65 per gallon of gasoline.

## Environmental Impacts
Methods of producing methanol exhibit the following greenhouse gas emissions.

#### Sources: Data et al. [^7], Ellis and Svanberg [^8], Energy Technology System Analysis Programme [^9], and Qin et al. [^17]. Schlömer et al. [^20] report the energy intensity of electricity. Emissions from gasoline, reported by the EPA [^28], are shown for comparison.

Methanol is an energy carrier, not an energy source that is readily available from nature, and there is necessarily a loss when coverting a primary energy source into methanol.

#### Sources: Bromberg and Chen [^3] and Dana et al. [^7]. Data from Building Energy Codes Program [^5] is used to estimate the primary energy behind electricity.

## Methanol as a Transportation Fuel
Like ethanol, methanol can be blended into the gasoline supply, with a maximum ratio of about 10% without requiring modification of engines of internal combustion vehicles [^25]. Furthermore, methanol and ethanol can be blended independently, forming gasoline-ethanol-methanol (GEM) fuels. Methanol blending into gasoline has become common in several countries, particularly China, where M15 (15% methanol blend) constituted 23% of all gasoline sold in the country in 2013 [^6].
