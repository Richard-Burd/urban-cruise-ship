#### Proposed energy solutions. See the following and the other sections of the site for more details.


## Energy Research

Public investment in [research and development](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/policy_se) 
for new energy technologies may be necessary to accelerate their deployment and displace established 
technologies with severe environmental costs. See our 
[nuclear page](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/nuclear) and our 
[ocean energy page](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/mhk) for details on the costs and 
benefits of bringing new technologies to market.

## Carbon Pricing

Our figures for the costs and benefits of 
[carbon pricing](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/carbon_pricing_e) are based on analysis 
of several recent proposals in the United States Congress. See our review of carbon pricing for more details.
