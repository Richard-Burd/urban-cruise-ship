# This is an MDX Markdown page

## The styling for this markdown is setup in "tailwind-styles.css"

This is a list in markdown items:
This is <b>bold</b> text, this is <i>italic</i> text
- One
- Two
- Three

We need a plugin in order to get these footnotes working,
once that plugin is installed, it needs to go into the

```next.config.js```
---
file


I already installed this guy:
---
```$ npm install remark-gfm```
---

that I saw here

```https://mdxjs.com/docs/extending-mdx/#list-of-plugins```
