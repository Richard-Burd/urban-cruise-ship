Extremophiles

Extremophiles are organisms that live in conditions that are harsh for most life. The recent discovery of extremophile organisms in the harshest ecological niches on Earth raise hopes that life might also be found elsewhere in the Solar System.

## Life in the Solar System
So far, there is no widely accepted evidence of life in the Solar System outside of Earth. The most promising candidates for the existence of such life are suggested as follows.

| Celestial Body | Most Likely Location | Evidence | Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|
| Venus | Upper Atmosphere | Phosphine gas, lacking clear abiotic production methods, was detected [^16], though this is disputed [^64]. | Lack of water [^19] |
| Mars | Subsurface, where liquid water exists [^21]. | Contemporary water and methane atmosphere [^54]. | Radiation [^50], toxic perchlorates [^39], saltiness of water [^4], low atmospheric pressure [^53] |
| Europa (moon of Jupiter) | Subsurface Ocean [^21] | Plumes of water and organic molecules found [^21] | Radiation from Jupter [^21] |
| Enceladus (moon of Saturn) | Subsurface Ocean [^21] | Plumes of water found erupting from surface [^21]. |
| Titan (moon of Saturn) | Surface | Basic elements of life (C, H, N, O, P, S) found [^21]. | Lack of liquid water [^21]. |

Mercury [^49], the asteroid Ceres [^45], Jupiter's moon Ganymede, Saturn's moon Dione, Neptune's moon Triton [^21], Jupiter's moon Callisto, the Kuiper Belt [^13], and smaller icy objects with subsurface oceans [^58] are also of astrobiological interest.

It has been suggested that NASA's Viking missions in 1976 found evidence of life [^18], but this is considered unlikely [^28], [^37]. There is also inconclusive evidence that life from Mars has been detected in the meterorite ALH84001 [^32]. It may be possible for microbial life to move between planets via panspermia [^22], [^44], [^60], which suggests that if life is found elsewhere in the Solar System, it might still be related to Earth life.

## Life outside the Solar System
Even if the conditions for life are rarely met, the universe is vast, creating great uncertainty as to just how much life there exists. Much extrasolar astrobiological research focuses on the circumstellar habitable zone, which is the region around a star where Earthlike planets can retain liquid water on their surface [^11]. Even within the habitable zone, there are potential obstacles to life taking hold, some of which are reviewed below.

| Location | Challenge for Life |
|---|---|
| Around M-drawf (red dwarf) stars, the most common type of star | Severe solar flares and tidal locking [^34]. |
| Around large stars | Too much UV radiation [^52], short stellar lifetimes. |
| Large galaxies | Sterilizing events and too many gas giants [^67]. |
| Too close to the galactic center | Sterilizing events such as X-ray bursts and supernovae [^15]. |
| Too far from the galactic center | Insufficient heavy elements to form rocky planets [^15]. |
| Multiple-star systems | Difficulty forming stable orbits and climates [^68]. |

Even if a planet is in the right spot, it must have plate tectonics [^30], must avoid runaway greenhouse effects or freezing [^42], and must satisfy other conditions, in addition to factors of chance [^63]. For these reasons, the rare Earth hypothesis has been put forward, which posits that life more complex than the most simple prokaryotic cells is rare enough that humanity is unlikely to ever detect it [^65].

In contrast to this, recent research suggests that cold planets can maintain subsurface oceans, heated by radioactivity or other forces. This may hold even in rogue planets that are in interstellar space and not in orbit around any star [^1]. Such rogue planets may outnumber planets that orbit stars [^25]. Hycean planets, or large ocean worlds, appear to be common and may be another promising home for life [^36].

Several ongoing and upcoming missions are intended to search for biosignatures, indicators of the presence of life, on exoplanets. One of them is the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in December 2021. It will look for spectral lines from exoplanets suggesting the presence of gases, such as high levels of oxygen, that would only exist in the presence of life [^35].

## Alternative Biochemistry
There is no consensus on the definition of life. NASA considers life to be "a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution" [^43]. Nothing in NASA's formulation precludes life based on radically different biochemistries than what is familiar on Earth.

Habitability discussions often revolve around conditions conducive to life as we know it on Earth, but there are hypothetical biochemistries that might allow other forms of life to thrive elsewhere. Some proposed alternatives are as follows.

| Description | Difference from Earth Life | Possible Habitats | Challenges  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Silicon | Silicon instead of carbon as a basis for organic chemistry. | Hot environments [^8] | Compared to carbon, silicon is less common and can form fewer compounds [^24]. |
| Metal oxide | Oxidized metals, such as tungesten, instead of carbon [^51]. | Hot environments such as Mercury | - |
| Hydrogen Sulfide | Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a solvent instead of water [^3] | Interstellar planets | - |
| Ammonia | Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) as a solvent [^3] | Interstellar planets with ammonia lakes | - |
| Hydrogen Peroxide | Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) as a solvent | Mars [^23] | - |
| Liquid Nitrogen | Liquid nitrogen as a solvent | Cold environments, such as Triton, a moon of Neptune [^10]. | - |
| Supercritical hydrogen | Hydrogen as a solvent | Gas giants [^10] | Requires high pressure; areas where this is possible may be limited. |
| Sulfuric Acid | Sulfuric acid as a solvent | Clouds of Venus [^10] | - |
| Supercritical carbon dioxide | Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> as a solvent | Large planets with dense, high-pressure atmospheres [^6]. | - |
| Silicon Dioxide | Silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) as a solvent | Very hot environments [^29]. | - |
| Methane | Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) as a solvent | Titan, a moon of Saturn [^41]. | - |
| Dust and Plasma | Behaviors of life shown by dust particles suspented in plasma [^62]. | Interstellar medium | - |
| Cosmic necklace | Magenetic monopoles connected by cosmic strings [^2]. | Interior of stars | - |

## Intelligent Life
The existence of extraterrestrial life is speculative, and of extraterrestrial civilization, even more speculative. The Drake equation [^12], developed by the astronomer Frank Drake, is a rough attempt at a framework for thinking about this question.

#### Source: Wikipedia.

The parameters, and some rough estimates of them, are as follows.

| Parameter | Description | Estimate |
|---|---|---|
| N | Number of civilizations in the Milky Way with which we can communicate. | Anywhere from 1 (humans are the only civilization in the galaxy) to millions [^55] |
| R* | Average rate of star formation in the Milky Way | 1.5-3 per year [^27], [^48] |
| f<sub>p</sub> | Fraction of stars that have planets | Close to 1 [^7] |
| n<sub>e</sub> | 	For each star with planets, the average number that can support life | Very uncertain. 0.1 [^33], maybe less [^65] |
| f<sub>l</sub> | Fraction of planets that can support life that actually do harbor life | Close to 1 [^66], but very little hard evidence |
| f<sub>l</sub> | Fraction of planets with life that develop intelligent life | 0.0002 [^46] or near 1 [^66] |
| f<sub>c</sub> | 	Fraction of civilizations that release signals into space | Near 1 [^66] |
| L | Average length of time that a civilization emits signals | 420 years [^56] or billions of years [^17] |

The Fermi paradox, attributed to the physicist Enrico Fermi, asks if there are possibly many intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way, why do we not see clear evidence of them [^26]? Many answers have been proposed, though none has achieved consensus. It may be, as per the Rare Earth Hypothesis [^65], that life is too rare for other civilizations to have been detected, or perhaps life is common but intelligent life is rare.

Several efforts to detect alien intelligent life have been attempted and so far turned up no convincing discoveries.

| Phenomenon | Possible Intelligence Explanation | Observational Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1977 Wow! Signal | Anomolous radio pulses might indicate a civilization's communication. | Unknown, possibly from a comet [^14]. |
| 'Oumuamua | Bracewell probe using solar sail technology | Most likely a natural comet [^61] |
| KIC 8462852, also known as Tabby's Star or Boyajian's Star | Dimming might be caused by construction of a Dyson swarm | Probably dust [^38] |
| Galaxy-scale infrared light | A Kardeshev Type III civilization might build sufficiently many Dyson spheres to be detected at intergalactic distances | A survey of 100,000 galaxies found no evidence of excess infrared light [^69]. |
| Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) | Alien spacecraft using speculative technology | Many mundane explanations are offered for UFO sightings. |

## Fine Tuning and the Anthropic Principle
The fine-tuned universe is the notion that only a small portion of the full space of cosmic physical parameters is conducive for life, and we happen to live in a universe that shows this property. There are many formulations of the fine tuning principle, one of which is as follows.

| Constant | Observed Value | Consequences if Different |
|---|---|---|
| Ratio of the electromagnetic force to the gravitational force between a pair of protons | ~10<sup>36</sup> | 	If much smaller, a long-lasting universe would be impossible. |
| Percentage of mass converted to energy when four nucleons fuse into Helium-4 | 0.007 | If much less, only hydrogen would exist. If much more, no hydrogen would exist. |
| Ratio of the mass density of the universe to "critical density" | Close to 1 | If too big, universe would collapse quickly. If too small, stars could not form. |
| Cosmological constant, ratio of the density of dark energy to the critical energy density of the universe | ~10<sup>-122</sup> | If much larger, space would have expanded too fast for star formation. |
| Ratio of the gravitational energy required to pull a large galaxy apart to the energy equivalent of its mass | ~10<sup>-5</sup> | If too small, stars could not form. If too large, stars could not survive. |
| Number of spatial dimensions | 3, excluding possible compactified dimensions posited by string theory | Life could not exist in 2 or 4 dimensions. |

Responses to apparent fine tuning often invoke the anthropic principle [^5]. The weak anthropic principle is a form of survivorship bias, that the universe must be fine tuned for life because if it wasn't, no one could notice that fact. The strong anthropic principle holds that fine tuning is evidence that the universe was created for conscious life, either by God or by an advanced intelligence.

| Proposed Solution | Rationale | Anthropic Principle |
|---|---|---|
| Multiverse [^9] | There must be many universes, only some of which are conducive to life | Weak anthropic principle |
| Top-down cosmology [^20] | 	Initial universe consisted of a superposition of many conditions | Weak anthropic principle |
| Carbon chauvinism [^59] | Conscious life might be radically different from humans and could thrive with different cosmic constants | No anthropic principle |
| Independent Parameters [^31] | The many seemingly independent variables constituting fine-tuning may indicate deeper, still-unknown physics. | No anthropic principle | 
| Alien Design [^57] | Our universe was designed by another intelligence, leading to a sort of natural selection | Strong anthropic principle |
| Intelligent Design [^40] | God designed the universe to be hospitable to humans | Strong anthropic principle |
