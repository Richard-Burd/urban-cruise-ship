# Manufacturing
Factories in orbit offer two features not available on the surface of the Earth: microgravity and the potential for a high quality vacuum. For these reasons, orbital manufacturing may allow products that are harder or impossible to manufacture on the surface [^1].

## Space Station Economics

A 2018 analysis found that a private space station would be economically profitable only under optimistic outcomes for both the cost and revenue of the station.

The partners of the International Space Station have identified several values created by the ISS: technology advancement and spinoffs, Earth observation, scientific advancement, building industries related to space, and education [^11]. However, it is difficult to quantify the economic value of these contributions and compare it to the cost.

## ZBLAN Fiber Optics
ZBLAN (zirconium, barium, lanthanum, aluminum, sodium) is a type of glass that can be used to manufacture fiber optics with significantly lower optical loss than conventional fiber optics. Manufacturing ZBLAN fibers at scale requires a microgravity environment than can be attained at an orbital factory [^6].

The manufacture of ZBLAN has been demonstrated on parabolic flights, and orbital demonstration is necessary to prove the viability of the concept [^8].

## Replacement Organs
The bioprinting of tissue or organs may also benefit from a microgravity environment [^9]. There is a shortage of organs available for transplant, and the shortage causes an estimated 7000 deaths in the United States per year [^4]. Aside from terrestrial use, orbital bioprinting is of interest to support astronaut health on longer missions [^2][^3].

Similar technology is of interest to produce synthetic meat. Due to the cost of transporting it to Earth, the meat would most likely be for astronauts rather than terrestrial humans [^2].

## Other Products
Beyond ZBLAN fiber optics, a microgravity environment may help manufacture a range of materials, including metal-organic frameworks, ceramics, semiconductors, metamaterials, multiphase materials, and superalloys that could not be manufactured in an environment with gravity [^5].
