# Mapping
Satellites are a large and growing business.

The space industry, which includes satellites as its largest component, is growing rapidly and projected to continue to do so.

The growth is driven by falling launch costs, which were $16,000-30,000 per kilogram prior to 2010, $1500/kg in 2020, and projected to reach $100/kg by 2040 [^3].

The space industry is broad, and in encompasses areas included satellite television, Internet service [^3], mapping, weather forecasting and climate modeling [^4], and many others. Emerging and speculative applications include space tourism, intercity travel via rocket, space-based solar power, resource mining, R&D, and construction [^3]. Major powers also view space as a crucial domain for national defense [^5].

## GPS

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a constellation of satellites to provide accurate location information anywhere on the Earth's surface. Developed by the U.S. Department of Defense, it is estimated that the constellation cost $12 billion to launch, $750 million per year to maintain [^6], and has generated $1.4 trillion in economic value, with 90% of that value generated since 2010 as more applications become commercially available [^7].
