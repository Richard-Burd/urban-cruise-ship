# Colonization
Establishing permanent, self-sustaining settlements on Earth will be very challenging and, for the foreseeable future, does not seem to be feasible.

## Energy Needs
An offworld habitat will have high energy needs, as it will probably require [intensive](/matter/practices/indoor) [agriculture](/matter/practices/synthetic_ag) and energy-intensive recycling of air, water, and material. Furthermore, electrical options such as synthetic fuels must substitute for the lack of fossil fuels. Estimate of energy needs are as follows.

## Food

Self-sufficiency in food is necessary for any off-world settlement to be sustainable. The tools for achieving this will be similar to those for high-intensity agriculture on Earth to conserve land, and requiring few sources, such as hydroponics [^10]. A bioengineered potato is a likely candidate for such a food [^9].

## Conservation

As larger numbers of people and quantity of industry move off-world, contemporary principles of planetary protection will not be viable, and new principles of conservation will be needed. One approach, at the beginning of the settlement process on Mars or on other planetary bodies, is to establish planetary parks, or areas that are to kept free of settlement and industrialization, in a process analogous to zoning [^7].

## Governance

Analogous to the current Antarctic Treaty, which establishes an Antarctic secretariat, a Mars secretariat to adjudicate disputes between separate Martian settlements will reduce the risk of conflict between them [^7]. Colonization parties could remain under the jurisdiction of terrestrial host nations and claim exclusive economic rights over plots of land while remaining consistent with the non-appropriation principle of the Outer Space Treaty [^8].
