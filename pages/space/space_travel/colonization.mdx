# Colonization
Establishing permanent, self-sustaining settlements on Earth will be very challenging and, for the foreseeable future, does not seem to be feasible.

## Energy Needs
An offworld habitat will have high energy needs, as it will probably require [intensive](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/indoor) [agriculture](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/foodwater/synthetic_ag) and energy-intensive recycling of air, water, and material. Furthermore, electrical options such as synthetic fuels must substitute for the lack of fossil fuels. Estimate of energy needs are as follows.
