## Launch Costs
The following are launch costs for the Falcon Heavy rocket.

#### Falcon Heavy launch costs, reported by SpaceX [^21].

Costs have fallen substantially since the era of the space shuttle, which required $54,500 to deliver a kilogram to low earth orbit [^6]. Next generation designs, such as SpaceX's Starship [^6], might further substantially reduce costs.

Energy consumption of the Falcon Heavy, a frequently used SpaceX rocket, are as follows.

#### Launch energy of the Falcon Heavy, including the primary energy behind the RP-1 rocket fuel and liquid oxygen, but not to manufacture the rocket or other upstream costs. Total fuel needs are estimated from Spaceflight 101 [^22], energy intensity of kerosene (of which RP-1 is a variant) from MacKay [^9], LOX from Shen and Wolsky [^19], and primary energy conversions from Building Energy Codes Program [^2].

Most rocket launches are to place satellites. From 2016 through 2018, launches went to the following destinations.

## Alternatives to Chemical Rockets
The rocket equation determines the fuel required to accelerate a rocket via on-board propulsion [^20].

#### The rocket equation. Δv is the desired change in velocity, ve = Ispg0 the exhaust velocity, m0 the initial mass (including propellant), mf the mass without propellant, and ln the natural log function. The rocket equation is idealized, and in reality the propellant required is slightly greater due to incomplete combustion, angled exhaust vector, atmospheric drag, etc. Image credit: [^Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation)

The following are approximate Δv requirements for common destinations.

Rockets are typically 85-90% propellant by mass at liftoff [^15]. Efforts to develop alternative launch systems typically do so through either increasing the propellant exhaust velocity or using alternatives to on-board propellant for propulsion.

The following exhaust velocities can be achieved from differing rocket fuels.

#### Sources: Parkin and Lambot [^13], Peschka [^14], Pettit [^15].

Methane and hydrogen present engineering challenges, though methane is of particular interest since it can be synthesized on the Moon or Mars for a return trip [^5].

Thermal rockets--nuclear [^11], microwave [^13], laser [^12], and solar [^17]--are active areas of research but are not in use today, though a solar thermal rocket is not suitable for launch from Earth. Microwave and laser thermal rockets are appealing options because they separate the energy source from the rocket. A microwave thermal rocket could achieve launch costs to low earth orbit as low as $125/kg [^13]. However, substantial research and development is still needed, and microwave and laser thermal rockets would require highly capital intensive ground facilities [^13].

A spaceplane, such as the single-stage-to-orbit Skylon plane current under development [^18], is air-breathing, thus reducing the thrust-to-weight ratio relative to rockets. However, it is not likely to be competitive in the launch market [^3].

There are many proposals for launch megastructures that use electromagnetic or mechanical lift, such as the StarTram [^16], launch loop [^8], orbital ring [^10], space elevator [^4], and skyhook [^1]. Each of these concepts relies on speculative engineering and is probably not a near term option.

In the near term, there are no alternatives that are likely to displace chemical rockets, though nuclear, microwave, and laser thermal rockets are promising areas for research and development.
