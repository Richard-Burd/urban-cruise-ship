# Propulsion
Following are select methods, currently in use and proposed, for propelling spacecraft that are already in space.

<div className="table-title"> Present Day Space Propulsion </div>
<div className="table-wrapper">

| Method | Energy Source | Use Case | Example Project | Exhaust Velocity (if applicable) | Rationale | Challenges |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chemical Rocket | Chemical Reaction | Launch, upper stages | Widely used | Up to 4.5 km/s | Established technology |   |
| Hydrazine | Chemical Reaction | Satellite Maneuvering | Widely used | 2.3 km/s | Easily used as a monopropellant | Highly toxic |
| Gravity Assist | Gravitational Potential Energy | Interplanetary Travel | Voyager, many other interplanetary missions | Depends on circumstances. Galileo gained 18.3 km/s from a Venus-Earth-Earth assist. | Save propellant | May require slow, indirect routes |
| Pulsed Plasma Thruster | Electricity (solar, radioisotope) | Small Satellite Maneuvering | Earth Observing 1 satellite | 5-60 km/s | Simple design | Less efficient than other electric options |
| Ion Drive | Electricity | Satellites, low-mass robotic probes | Dawn | 20-50 km/s | High impulse | Low thrust. Thrust may increase with next generation Hall thruster. |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nuclear Thermal Rocket | Nuclear Fission | Crewed Mission to Mars | NERVA | 8.3 km/s | Most promising near-term option for large, high-impulse craft | Safety may preclude use as a booster stage |
| Magnetoplasmadynamic Thruster | Electricity, most likely from fission | Large interplanetary spacecraft | Space Flyer Unit | 15-60 km/s | High impulse and thrust | High power needed, likely necessitating a new reactor design, degradation of cathodes limits lifespan. |
| Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket | Fission | Crewed interplanetary missions | Ad Astra Rocket Company | 50 km/s | Balance between low thrust, high impulse and high thrust, low impulse designs | Required power system might not be feasible. |
| Solar Sail | Solar Power | Interplanetary transport of goods, deorbiting satellites | IKAROS | c (propellantless) | Low cost, propellantless craft, faster travel to outer Solar System | Cannot operate in Earth orbit below 800 km. |
| Direct Fusion Drive | Nuclear Fusion | Interplanetary travel | Princeton Satellite Systems | 100 km/s | High thrust and exhaust velocity | Much R&D required on the fusion generator |

#### Data sources are as follows: chemical rockets (see above), hydrazine [^7], [^13], gravity assist [^5], pulsed plasma thruster [^11], ion drives [^3][^14], nuclear thermal rockets [^6], magnetoplasmadynamic thruster [^3], [^9], VASIMR [^1], [^12], solar sail [^19], Direct Fusion Drive [^18], beamed propulsion [^15], magnetic sails [^2], nuclear pulse propulsion [^17], ACNP [^16], antimatter rocket [^8], and black hole drive [^4], [^10].

The best propulsion options depend on the application. For more efficient satellite maneuvering and for uncrewed interplanetary probes, further improvement to ion drives may be the most promising option. For crewed interplanetary missions, nuclear thermal rockets may hold the most potential. There is little prospect for interstellar probes, let alone crewed interstellar flight, on the horizon.
