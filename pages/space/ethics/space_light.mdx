# Light and Astronomy
Light pollution interferes with ground-based astronomy in several ways. See also our discussion of light pollution in the context of Cities.

## Satellites and Light Pollution

Low-earth satellites, especially the Internet collections such as Starlink that are now under development, raise concerns about light pollution that could interfere with ground-based astronomy [^1].

As present, some but not all U.S. Federal agencies apply the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to orbital impacts. It is considered to legislatively mandate that this always happens [^1].

## LEDs and Light Pollution

Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have greatly improved energy efficiency over alteratives, but they emit more light at lower (blue) wavelengths, causing greater skyglow disruption to wildlife's circadian rhythm per unit of lighting.

White LEDs pose a tradeoff between energy efficiency, visibility, and ecological impact, for which there is not an obvious solution in general [^3]. White LEDs are also more visually pleasing to humans than other lighting options [^4]. Blue-free white LEDs, which could retain high energy efficiency while reducing ecological disruption, are an active area of development [^5].
