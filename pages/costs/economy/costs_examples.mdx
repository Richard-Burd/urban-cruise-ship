## Examples

We have proposed a number of strategies to internalize costs or benefits of activities through taxes or subsidies.

<CostExamplesTable />

export default ({ children }) => 
  <Article 
    focusAreaUrl={focusAreaUrl} 
    hierarchy={hierarchy} 
    site={site}
  >
    {children}
  </Article
