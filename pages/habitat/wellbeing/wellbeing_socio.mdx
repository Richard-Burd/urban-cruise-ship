# Well-Being

Aside from avoiding [premature death](/habitat/wellbeing/health_socio), people have material and social needs to live prosperous lives. Life satisfaction is a measure of well-being that asks people to rate their overall satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10 [^7]. Life events and changes have been estimated to have the following impacts on life satisfaction.

## Income and Well-Being
Of great interest, in considering national economic policy, is the link between national income or GDP and overall well-being. The Easterlin Paradox [^5] holds that, beyond a certain level of economic development, additional national income does not improve national happiness. Since then, several studies have examined the relationship further, with the weight of evidence that even wealthier countries see happiness gains from additional economic growth. Following is a summary of select studies.

<div className="table-title">Income and Well-Being Correlation</div>
<div className="table-wrapper">

| Study | Conclusion |
| --- | --- |
| Easterlin, 2017 | Short term correlation between happiness and GDP but no long-term correlation |
| Layard, 2003 | National happiness grows with income but saturates at around $23,000 per capita (2020 dollars). |
| Yu & Chen, 2016 | Positive emotions associated with relative income position, negative emotions with absolute position |
| Kahneman & Deaton, 2010 | Life satisfaction rises with income indefinitely, emotional well-being caps at around $90,000/year (2020 dollars). |
| Stevenson & Wolfers, 2008 | GDP and happiness are correlated at all income levels, within countries, between countries, and over time |
| Diener et al., 2013 | Rising incomes lead to improved subjective well-being, even in wealthier countries, and benefits are persistent. |
| Veenhoven & Vergunst, 2014 | At all income levels, a 1% increase in GDP/cap/year is followed by a 0.0034 points rise in happiness. |
| Diener et al., 1993 | Income produces happiness at all levels in the United States, no evidence the effect is relative. |

#### Select studies that examine the relationship between national GDP or income and happiness. Studies cited: [^3], [^4], [^6], [^8], [^10], [^17], [^22], [^23].

Studies generally find a linear relationship between well-being and the log of income (e.g. [^17] and [^22]). This means that, at higher levels of wealth, a greater increase of income is needed to produce the same increase of well-being.

## Measures of Well-Being
Several alternatives to gross domestic product (GDP) have been proposed as measures of national well-being.

<div className="table-wrapper">

| Metric | Includes | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Genuine Progress Indicator | Economic measures include personal income, housework and parenting, volunteer work, higher education, value of infrastructure, net capital, and financial flows. Several social and environmental metrics, measured solely as costs. | UN [^2] |
| OECD's Better Life Index | Material well-being (income, jobs, housing), quality of life metrics, sustainability (natural, human, economic, social capital). | UN [^2] |
| Human Development Index | Life expectancy, schooling, income | UNDP [^20] |
| Bhutan's Gross National Happiness | Nine domains, revolving around sustainable and equitable development, environmental conservation, preservation and promotion of culture, and good governance | Ura et al. [^21] |
| Sweden's Wellbeing Index | GDP per capita, (un)employment, household and government debt, air and water quality, land protection, chemical pollution, greenhouse gases, poverty, health, education, trust, life satisfaction. | Government of Sweden [^12] |

#### Many sources assert that economists and politicians pursue "economic growth at all costs", and while this is an exaggeration [^16] (policies that pursue other social goals at the expense of GDP are prevalent around the world), other metrics of social well-being are welcome. Decisions on how to weigh factors, and which factors to include, in any metric that purports to be a universal measure of well-being are necessarily political decisions.

Building on the work of Easterlin [^6] (see also Layard [^10]), many researchers assert that happiness and human well-being saturate at a wealth point which much of the world has now surpassed. Several other researchers (for example, see [^3], [^4], [^8], [^17], [^22]) have come to the conclusion that well-being continues to increase at income levels at least as high as the highest in the world today.

## Close Relationships

The prevalence of close relationships is an important aspect of well-being. The number of close friendships for Americans shows signs of substantial decrease.
