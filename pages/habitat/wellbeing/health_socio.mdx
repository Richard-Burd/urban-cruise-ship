# Health and Safety

## Cause of Death
In 2019, about 57 million people died in the following ways.

The following portrays estimated deaths by risk factors. Not all deaths can be attributed to the following risk factors, and multiple risk factors may contribute to a particular death.

The leading cause of indoor air pollution is cooking fuel [^24].

## Costs of Addressing Risk Factors
The World Bank estimates a cost of $88 to $213 billion per year to provide universal access to safe and affordable drinking water, sanitation, safe human waste disposal, and hygiene [^11], or $54,000 to $132,000 per death to which unclean water contributes.

## Existential Risk
In addition to risks that affect individual human lives, there are risks that threaten civilization or humanity as a whole and may be much more serious, especially over the long term, than currently observed damages. The worst case outcome of climate change is one such risk.

<div className="table-title">Existential Risks</div>
<div className="table-wrapper">

| Risk Factor | Current Damages | Worst Case Scenario | Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Climate Change | Estimated 250,000 annual deaths in 2030 (WHO). At a social cost of carbon of $50/tom, current annual emissions cause $2 trillion of long-term damage. | Catastrophic Risk | Ongoing warming and damages are certain. The worst mainstream projection is a loss of 22-37% under RCP8.5 (Burke). Worse is possible under extreme outcomes, such as release of methane hydrates, but likelihood of such events is unknown, and they will unfold over centuries | Deplow low carbon energy, energy efficiency, carbon removal, adaption to changing climate, geoengineering. |
| Artificial Intelligence Catastrophe | Cybercrime caused an estimated $3 trillion in damages in 2015 and is projected to reach %6 trillion in 2021 (Herjavec Group) | Human Extinction | Not imminent. Turchin and Denkenberger do not estimate the likelihood of an AI catastrophe but regard it as humanity's most serious existential risk. | Cybersecurity, improved software engineering practices, research into AI safety. |
| Pandemic | Infectious diseases kill over 8 million people per year (GBDCN). The 2020 coronavirus pandemic has killed over 120,000 people and caused tens of trillions of dollars of damage (update as needed). | Existential Risk | Annual risk of 1.6* 10<sup>.8</sup> to 10<sup>.7</sup> from lab escape, 1.4* 10<sup>.6</sup> from terrorism, 5*10<sup>.7</sup> from war (Millett and Snyder-Beattie). | Disease surveillance, capacity for testing, public health (hand washing, social distance, quarantne, etc.), vaccine and antiviral development, reserves of medical equipment, plan to ensure continuity of essential services (WHO), regulation of hazards such as biolabs and wet markets. |
| War | War and terrorism killed about 130,000 people in 2017 (GBDCN). World military spending was about $1.8 trillion in 2018 (SIPRI). The deadliest was in history, World War II, killed over 70 million people over six years, including deaths from war-related famine and disease and crimes against humanity. | Catastrophic risk | Annual risk of war of 0.01 (Lundgren). Worst case scenario and potential of existential risk depend on highly uncertain factors such as prospect of nuclear winter (Scouras). | Arms control, international diplomacy |
| Supervolcano | Earthquaks and volcanos caused on average 27,000 deaths and $37 billion in damages per year in the 2010's. Most deaths and damages occured in the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami respectively (EM-DAT) | Human Extinction | Annual risk of eruption 10<sup>.5</sup>, but an eruption would not necessarily end civilization (Turchin and Denkenberger). | Engineering responses such as drilling to release heat (Wilcox et al.). |
| Asteroid Impact | Since 1900, the only asteroid that has done suggnificant damage to humans was the 2013 Chelyabinsk impact, which caused 1600 injuries (Talbert) and $33 million in damages (EM_DAT) | Human Extinction | Annual risk of 10<sup>.8</sup>. Larger risk if lesser impacts. | Detection and Deflection (NASA) |
| Nanotechnology Catastrophe | None yet | Human Extinction  | Annual risk of destruction of life on Earth from "gray goo" catastrophe estimated at 10<sup>.4</sup> (1% in 21st Century) (Turchin and Denkenberger). Additional risk that molecular nanotechnology can be used to manufacture dangerious weapons. Such risks require substantial ansd speculative technological advancement. | Depends on how technology develops. |
| Physics Catastrophe | None | Destruction of Earth or Cosmos | Highly uncertain. Annual risk of at most 2*10<sup>.7</sup> for strangelet catastrophe estimated from the Relative Heavy Ion Collider (Dar ab et al.). Risks of catastrophes such as strangelet release, black hole creation, or vaccum collapse generally regarded as implausible (Ellis et al.). | Monitor novel experiments for potential risk. |

#### Partial list of risks that threaten civilization or humanity as a whole, or could cause a global catastrophe that kills a substantial fraction of the human population. Risks are chosen on the basis of estimated severity or high level of public concern, and not all plausible hazards to civilization are considered. Sources: Burke et al.
