# Chemical Pollution

Following, we examine the health and environmental impacts of several hazard exposures. See also our analysis of the [chemical industry](/energy/industry/chemicals_energy).

There are additional potentially hazardous material exposures, such as from unclassified neurotoxicants and endocrine disruptors, chemical pesticides, pharmaceutical waste, and emerging nanomaterials, for which the risk is not yet established [^7].

## Chemical Exposure
Dangerous elements and chemicals, transmitted through the air, water, food, consumer products, industrial production, or building materials are a major cause of illness and environmental damage. Due to the wide range of hazardous substances, the full cost is highly uncertain. Following, we estimate damages from major classes of chemical pollution.

Some hazardous substances, such as mercury--especially methylmercury chemicals that accumulate in life and food--cause debilitating illness, even if it is difficult to directly attribute deaths.

Following are select estimates of monetized damages from the health impact of hazardous material exposure.

#### Estimates of the health impact, expressed as monetized damages from suffering and lost productivity. As only select materials are considered, only the United States and the European Union except in the case of lead are assessed, and ecosystem damages are not considered, these figures significantly underestimate the full cost of chemical exposure.

## Radiation
Among sources of ionizing radiation, radon is the greatest threat to human health.

#### Actual dosage can vary widely, with high concentration of radon a particular threat when the gas accumulates in a confined space. Medical exposure varies widely depending on medical needs. Sources: Schauer and Linton [^10], with explanatory notes from the World Nuclear Association [^15].

<RadonSolution />

The linear no-threshold (LNT) model holds that the health damage from radiation exposure is proportional to the amount of exposure, even at very low doses. Several researchers and organizations, including the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Agency, endorse the LNT model [^lnt1], while the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation argues that low doses of radiation are less harmful than implied by LNT [^lnt2]. The majority of recent research supports LNT [^lnt3]. Rejection of the LNT model would lower the assessed risk of low doses of radiation and thus lower the appropriate level of regulation on radiation emissions from nuclear power plants.

## Nanomaterials

Nanomaterials are generally particles that are between 1 and 100 nanometers (billionths of a meter) on at least one dimension. While such materials have long been part of the natural world, production of novel nanomaterials is growing, with environmental and health implications that are unclear.

#### Source: Hochella et al. [^16].

Carbon-based nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, pose toxic hazards to plants, animals, and microbes [^17] and impose negative effects on human health [^18]. Long, thin carbon nanotubes can interact with the body in a manner similar to asbestos [^19]. Additional negative health impacts have been found with exposure to titanium dioxide and silver nanoparticles, while zinc oxide and cerium oxide were found to be relatively benign [^19].

World production of carbon nanotubes is increasingly rapidly and is forecast to exceed 50,000 tons per year in a few years [^20]. By comparison, world asbestos production peaked in 1977 at about 4.8 million tons per year [^21].

Many nanomaterials are also valuable for pollution remediation [^22].
