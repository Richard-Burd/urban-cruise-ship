# Chemical Pollution

Following, we examine the health and environmental impacts of several hazard exposures. See also our analysis of the [chemical industry](/energy/industry/chemicals_energy).

There are additional potentially hazardous material exposures, such as from unclassified neurotoxicants and endocrine disruptors, chemical pesticides, pharmaceutical waste, and emerging nanomaterials, for which the risk is not yet established [^7].

## Chemical Exposure
Dangerous elements and chemicals, transmitted through the air, water, food, consumer products, industrial production, or building materials are a major cause of illness and environmental damage. Due to the wide range of hazardous substances, the full cost is highly uncertain. Following, we estimate damages from major classes of chemical pollution.

Some hazardous substances, such as mercury--especially methylmercury chemicals that accumulate in life and food--cause debilitating illness, even if it is difficult to directly attribute deaths.

#### The DALY metric measures the number of years of life lost, with partial years attributed to years living with illness or disability. Sources: Gibbs et al. [^4], Global Burden of Disease [^5].

Following are select estimates of monetized damages from the health impact of hazardous material exposure.

#### Estimates of the health impact, expressed as monetized damages from suffering and lost productivity. As only select materials are considered, only the United States and the European Union except in the case of lead are assessed, and ecosystem damages are not considered, these figures significantly underestimate the full cost of chemical exposure.

## Lead

As shown above, lead is by far the most damaging environmental pollutant that has been measured. Up to 800 million children worldwide have shown blood lead levels of at least 5 micrograms per decilitre, which is associated with a loss of 3-5 IQ points on standardized tests and observable behavioral impacts, and lead poisoning can be attributed to 900,000 premature deaths per year [^lead16].

A recent study puts worldwide productivity losses resulting from lead contamination at $906 billion [^lead17], though a more comprehensive estimate, which considers monetized health impacts and the impairment of highly exposed countries' economic growth, is $5-10 trillion annually [^lead6]. A 2010 study found $192-270 billion annually of damage from lead in the United States, almost all of which resulted from IQ loss and lifetime earning loss [^lead18]. Lead exposure is strongly linked with crime and other forms of antisocial behavior [^lead19].

### Lead Paint

There do not exist precise estimates of the level of human exposure by source, but it is believed that lead paint and lead acid battery recycling are the two most serious exposures.

<PhaseOutLeadUsageSolution />

### Lead Acid Batteries

Informal recycling of used lead acid batteries is a particular hazard for lead exposure [^lead6]. While formal recycling programs are safer and more efficient, informal programs are cheaper where labor costs are low [^lead7]. Strategies to divert lead acid batteries away from informal recycling include subsidies for formal recycling, which may include elimination of the goods and services tax; and a deposit on the manufacture or import of lead acid batteries that is returned upon formal manufacturing [^lead6].

Studies in the Dominican Republic [^lead8], Vietnam [^lead9], and Bangladesh [^lead10] have shown that remediation of informal lead acid battery recycling sites is cost effective.

### Leaded Gasoline

Leaded gasoline was once responsible for at least 90% of human lead exposure [^lead1]. In the 1970s, with growing awareness of the health and environmental hazards of lead pollution, the U.S. Congress began the process of eliminating leaded gasoline. Due to the cost of compliance, this process was not completed until 1996 [^8]. In 2021, Algeria became the last country to ban leaded gasoline [^1]. The health and environmental benefits of the phaseout of leaded gasoline has been estimated to exceed the cost by a factor of five to ten [^2].

However, leaded aviation gasoline, used for small piston-engine planes that carry 2-10 passengers and not for commercial jets, remains in use [^lead2]. In 2023, the United States Environmental Protection Agency published an endangerment finding on leaded aviation gasoline, paving the way for regulation under the Clean Air Act [^lead3]. The Eliminate Aviation Gasoline Lead Emissions (EAGLE) program, a consortium of the Federal Aviation Administration and the aviation community, seeks to deploy safe, unleaded aviation gasoline and eliminate leaded aviation gasoline by 2030 [^lead4].

Aviation gasoline in the United States today is 100LL (100 octane low lead aviation gasoline). An alternative, 100VLL (100 octane very low lead aviation gasoline) is a suitable drop-in replacement for 100LL, but it would require that general airports provide new fueling options, and it reduces lead content by only 20%. Another alternative, UL94, meets the ASTM standards for unleaded fuel and avoids tetraethyl lead (TEL) additives, but it may not be usable for high-performance general aviation aircraft without modification. Work to develop drop-in, unleaded aviation gasoline is ongoing [^lead5].

### Other Sources of Lead Exposure

Spices, particularly tumeric, are sometimes adulterated with lead to grant them a more vibrant appearance. This has been identified as a cause of lead poisoning around the world, including in the United States. The Food And Drug Administration can take several measures to protect American consumers, such as more stringent screening of imported spices for lead contamination [^lead11]. A public education campaign on the dangers of lead adulteration in areas of Asia in which adulteration is most prevalent may be a cost-effective way to improve health [^lead6].

Unavoidable contamination of lead and other harmful heavy metals may be present in the material used to produce cookware [^lead12]. A fluoropolymer finish can greatly reduce cookware leaching, and this finish adds modestly to cost, but mandating coating may be difficult where small-scale producers predominate, and fluoropolymers carry their own health hazards [^lead6].

The United States has not allowed new lead pipes in decades, but many exist and leach lead into the water supply. In 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency announced consideration of a plan that would remove all lead pipes within 10 years [^lead13]. Where removal is not cost-feasible, it may be possible to apply an electric current in a lead pipe, which would cause more lead ions to leach and react with phosphates in the water to create a mineral barrier and prevent most further leaching [^lead14].

Lead ammunition and fishing sinkers creates an environmental hazard, particularly for migratory birds, and a human health hazard through ingestion of game meat that contains lead [^12]. This can be eliminated with non-lead alternatives, such as copper alloys [^lead15].




## Persistent Organic Pollutants

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are long-lastic organic chemicals. Pesticides, such as DDT, are the largest category of POPs, and other categories include cosmetics, solvents, and some industrial chemicals [^pop1]. The main tool to regulate POPs is the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, an international agreement to ban or restrict many classes of POPs [^pop2].

Exposure pathways to POPs include the following.

- As POPs are bioaccumulators, meat-based diets pose greater risk of exposure to endocrine disruptors [^pop6], though soy may also be an endocrine disruptor [^pop7]. Bioaccumulation through animal tissues are, for people not exposed to endocrine disruptors occupationally, the most potent means of exposure [^pop11].
- Exposure to daily objects, such as those containing brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) [^pop4]. Although the United States has banned the manufacture of PCBs, exposure remains a risk due to these chemicals' long persistence.
- Phthalates, such as bisphenol A (BPA), are often contained in food containers and can leech out when microwaved or exposed to sunlight [^pop5].
- Indoor air pollution [^pop8].
- Rainwater for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) [^pop9].
- Cosmetics [^pop10].

POPs are endocrine disruptors, and they have been linked with low sperm count and reproductive issues [^pop12] and developmental problems [^pop13].




## Radiation
Among sources of ionizing radiation, radon is the greatest threat to human health.

<ArticleImage image={"radiation_exposure.svg"} width={1000} height={500} />
#### Actual dosage can vary widely, with high concentration of radon a particular threat when the gas accumulates in a confined space. Medical exposure varies widely depending on medical needs. Sources: Schauer and Linton [^10], with explanatory notes from the World Nuclear Association [^15].

<RadonSolution />

The linear no-threshold (LNT) model holds that the health damage from radiation exposure is proportional to the amount of exposure, even at very low doses. Several researchers and organizations, including the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Agency, endorse the LNT model [^lnt1], while the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation argues that low doses of radiation are less harmful than implied by LNT [^lnt2]. The majority of recent research supports LNT [^lnt3]. Rejection of the LNT model would lower the assessed risk of low doses of radiation and thus lower the appropriate level of regulation on radiation emissions from nuclear power plants.




## Nanomaterials

Nanomaterials are generally particles that are between 1 and 100 nanometers (billionths of a meter) on at least one dimension. While such materials have long been part of the natural world, production of novel nanomaterials is growing, with environmental and health implications that are unclear.

<ArticleImage image={"nanomaterial_flow.svg"} width={1000} height={500} />
#### Source: Hochella et al. [^16].

Carbon-based nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, pose toxic hazards to plants, animals, and microbes [^17] and impose negative effects on human health [^18]. Long, thin carbon nanotubes can interact with the body in a manner similar to asbestos [^19]. Additional negative health impacts have been found with exposure to titanium dioxide and silver nanoparticles, while zinc oxide and cerium oxide were found to be relatively benign [^19].

World production of carbon nanotubes is increasingly rapidly and is forecast to exceed 50,000 tons per year in a few years [^20]. By comparison, world asbestos production peaked in 1977 at about 4.8 million tons per year [^21].

Many nanomaterials are also valuable for pollution remediation [^22].
