# Climate Change

Here we review the causes and effects of climate change, as well as adaptation as a response. See our broader [energy](http://urbancruiseship.org/site/energy) discussion of solutions for emissions reductions and our discussion of [geoengineering](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/habitat/geoengineering) approaches.

## The Climate Budget
Industrial activity has emitted about 2200 billion tons (Gt) of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) into the atmosphere. Meeting internationally agreed goals of 2 °C or 1.5 °C of global warming over preindustrial levels would require that no more than 1500 or 580 Gt additional CO<sub>2</sub> respectively, which would require a sharp reversal of the trend of growing emissions [^12].

## Source of Emissions
By sector, world greenhouse gas emissions are as follows as of 2016.

<ArticleImage image={"emissions_by_sector.svg"} width={750} height={380} />

Following are overall greenhouse gas emissions from human activity.

<ArticleImage image={"Global Warming Potential.svg"} width={1000} height={800} />
#### Sources: overall: IPCC [^12], carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>): Le Quéré et al. [^18], methane (CH<sub>4</sub>): Global Methane Initiative [^9], nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O): Davidson and Kanter [^6] and Winiwarter [^31], and fluorinated gases (F-gases): Purohit and Höglund-Isaksson [^23].

Addressing the major sources of emissions requires replacing most of the world's current energy [production](http://urbancruiseship.org/topic/energy/energy_production) with low carbon sources; reforming [agriculture](http://urbancruiseship.org/topic/energy/foodwater) to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from land use, methane from enteric fermentation, and nitrous oxide emissions; preventing the release of methane from decomposing organic matter in [landfills](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/recycling), and phasing out the use of F-gases in refrigeration and [air conditioning](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/heating) [^27].

## Current Impact of Climate Change
As of 2020, the world has warmed about a degree Celcius from the 1850-1900 average.

<ArticleImage image={"warming_by_decade.svg"} width={700} height={500} />
#### Source: IPCC [^14].

Emissions from human activity are responsible for most of the warming. Aside from warmer temperatures, consequences of climate change include glacial retreat, sea level rise, likely increase heat waves and droughts, and possibly increased wildfires and flooding [^14].

A 2021 study estimates that climate change will be responsible for 83 million deaths from 2020 to 2100 under the baseline scenario. This translates to one death for every 4,434 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, or the lifetime emissions of 3.5 Americans, an a carbon cost of $37-258 from only mortality [^3]. An estimated 37% of heat-related deaths, or about 60,000 of the 166 thousand total deaths, have been attributed to climate change [^28].

## Future Impact of Climate Change
The International Panel on Climate Change has identified four future scenarios, based on how much global warming occurs. A brief summary of their impacts is as follows.

<ArticleImage image={"rcp.svg"} width={980} height={900} />
#### Summary of the IPCC's Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. Radiative forcing, which gives rise to scenario names, refers to the amount of additional energy per square meter that will be captured by the greenhouse effect. 

#### The IPCC [^13] estimates warming levels and sea level rise. Lafakis et al. [^17] report estimated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration; as of 2020, concentration is about 410 parts per million and was about 250 ppm in pre-industrial times. Estimates on GDP impact are drawn from Kompas et al. [^16], Kahn et al. [^15], and Burke et al. [^5]. Wiebe et al. [^30] estimate impacts on crop yields. Their estimates may be pessimistic, as they do not account for CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization.

The most likely scenario, based on current trends, is between RCP4.5 and RCP6. RCP8.5 is an unlikely worst case scenario and should not be presented as "business as usual" [^11].

Under current policies, total warming should be around 3 °C, though with considerable uncertainty.

<ArticleImage image={"expected_warming.svg"} width={730} height={300} />
#### Source: Hausfather [^10].

The World Health Organization estimates that climate change will be responsible for about 250,000 deaths per year in 2030.

<ArticleImage image={"climate_deaths.svg"} width={690} height={270} />
#### Source: World Health Organization [^32].

Climate change is also expected to cause deaths through coastal flooding and storms, but precise estimates of the number of deaths are lacking [^32].

There are a number of potentially catastrophic outcomes from climate change whose likelihoods are unknown, including collapse of the West Antarctica Ice Sheet [^1], release of large quantities of methane from the Arctic permafrost [^26] or submerged methane hydrates [^19], induced seismic events [^21], and risks that are themselves unknown [^7]. The presence of unknown "fat tail" risks justifies a stronger response to climate change than consideration of only median or expected outcomes [^29].

## Impact of Emissions on Ecosystems
Over thousands of years, the oceans will absorb most excess carbon emissions; see our work on [ocean acidification](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/oceans/ocean_acid) for more on this topic. In the short term, carbon emissions travel as follows.

<ArticleImage image={"emissions_dest.svg"} width={580} height={290} />
#### Source: Peters et al. [^22].

A main effect of soil uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> is fertilization of plant growth. Based on satellite data, world vegetation growth may have increased 1.3-4.3% from 1982 to 2011, mostly as a result of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization. The following crop yield increases have been observed.

#### Yield increases of major crops from CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization, given an increase of 100 parts per million increase in atmospheric concentration. Figures are fertilization only and do not account for the impact of climate change. Source: McGrath and Lobell [^20].

## The Carbon Cycle
Most near-surface carbon is stored in the oceans.

<ArticleImage image={"c_storage.svg"} width={790} height={620} />
#### Storage of carbon near the Earth's surface. Far larger reserves of carbon are in the Earth's mantle, and this carbon is exchanged with the surface over geologic time via plate tectonics and volcanoes. Source: NASA [^24].

## Adaptation
Climate adaptation refers to efforts intended to reduce harms from climate change, as opposed to mitigation, which is intended to reduce climate change itself. Worldwide, adaptation spending is a fraction of mitigation spending.

<ArticleImage image={"climate_funding.svg"} width={700} height={500} />
#### Major purposes of world business, government, and non-profit spending on climate change. Figures are averages of 2017 and 2018 totals and represent all spending the Climate Policy Initiative is able to track, which may not be all climate spending. Source: Buchner et al. [^4].

The Global Commission on Adaptation has found $1.8 trillion of adaptation projects expected to have net benefits [^8].
