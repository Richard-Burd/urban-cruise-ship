# Geoengineering

Geoengineering can refer to any method of deliberately altering the Earth's climate or atmospheric composition. While direct air capture of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere and bioenergy and carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS) can be considered forms of geoengineering, we consider them in our analysis of [carbon capture and sequestration](/energy/industry/ccs).

## Approaches
Following is a summary of commonly considered geoengineering methods, their estimated costs, carbon removal or mitigation potential, limitations, and risks and drawbacks. See also our analysis of [ocean-based geoengineering](/oceans/ocean_environment/ocean_geoeng).

<div className="table-wrapper">

| Method | Description | Emissions Reduction Potential | Cost per Ton CO<sub>2</sub> | Limitations | Risks and Drawbacks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stratospheric Aerosal Injection | Release aerosols in the stratosphere to reflect sunlight and induce cooling. | Unlimited | $0.10 to $0.25 (Smith and Wagner) | Does not address ocean acidification | Termination could lead to abrupt temperature rise (Parker and Irvine), interstate conflict (Halstead), drought, ozone depletion, loss of sunlight (Rabock et al.). |
| Marine Cloud Brightening | Add aerosols to clouds to increase their reflectivity (NRC) | Reduce temperatures 0.6-1.1 °C | $0.13 (NRC) | Does not address ocean acidification. | Unknown effects on weather patterns. |
| Afforestation | Plant trees, which absorb CO<sub>2</sub> | 116 (Veldman et al.) to 564 (Bastin et al.) tons CO<sub>2</sub>e (3-14 years of emissions at 2060 levels) | $20-$50/ton, depending on amount of afforestation (Busch et al.) | Limited land available for forestation, potential land use conflict | Carbon sequestration potential of forests is highly debated (Lewis et al.). |
| Ocean Iron Fertilization | bSeed oceans with iron particles, which induce algae growth, absorb CO<sub>2</sub>, and sequester it in the deep ocean | 196-790 billion tons CO<sub>2</sub> over 100 years (NOAA), the equivalent of about 5-20 years of world emissions at 2020 rates | $13-133 (Boyd) | --- | Efficiency of iron in absorbing carbon is disputed, negative feedbacks are uncertain (NOAA). Ocean acidification would be exacerbated (NOAA). Unknown risk to ecosystems (Strong et al.) |
| Ocean Afforestation | Seed oceans with iron particles, which induce algae growth, absorb CO<sub>2</sub> and sequester it in the deep ocean | 36 billion tons CO<sub>2</sub> sequestered per year, almost to current emissions (N'Yeurt et al.). | $18 (N'Yeurt et al.) | --- | Many stress coastal ecosystems (Royal Society) |
| Wetland, peatland, and coastal habitat restoration | Active restoration | 0.4-20 billion tons CO<sub>2</sub>/year | $10-100 | --- | Short term release of methane and N<sub>2</sub>O. |
| Soil carbon sequestration | Modify farming practices to increase soil carbon content. | 1-10 billion tons CO<sub>2</sub>/year | -$10 to +$3 | Saturation of soil carbon in 10-20 years. | Carbon storage can be reversed. |
| Biochar | Pyrolsis of biomass into charcoal, to enhance carbon storage and improve soil fertility. | 3-5 billion tons CO<sub>2</sub>/year | $0-200 | --- | Reduced soil albedo may cause warming. |
| Biomass building materials | Increase use of plant-based building materials, such as wood, bamboo, straw, or hemp. | 0.5-1 billion tons CO<sub>2</sub>/year | $0 | Market size for new buildings | Fire risk. |
| Enhanced terrestrial weathering | Mill silicate rocks to increase the rate of weathering, which sequesters CO<sub>2</sub> | 0.5-4 billion tons CO<sub>2</sub>/year | $50-500 | --- | Energy intensive. |
| Mineral carbonization | Grind and treat minerals and react with CO<sub>2</sub> for stable sequestration. Resulting products may be commercially valuable | Effectively unlimited | $50-300 (above ground), $20 (below ground) | Below ground sequestration depends on geological availability. | Mining for materials, high energy consumption. |
| Ocean alkalinity | Add positive charged calcium or magnesium to the ocean to increase alkalinity and accelerate CO<sub>2</sub> uptake | 40 billion tons CO<sub>2</sub>/year | $70-200 | --- | Loss of alkalinity could reverse CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. Unknown risk to ecosystems. |

All proposed methods of geoengineering come with severe risk, limitations, and/or cost, though there is no reason to rule them out *a priori.*

## Solar Geoengineering
Solar geoengineering refers to a method to reduce the sunlight that reaches Earth's surface, such as stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening, and cirrus cloud thinning, and thus inducing cooling [^9]. While these are potentially useful and inexpensive tools, they carry possible unknown risks and do not address the problems of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration or ocean acidification. Modeling and limited field trials are appropriate at this time, but not full scale deployment [^9].

## Other Forms
There are several other methods sometimes discussed but not included above. The use of mirrors in orbit to reflect sunlight is at present impractical [^10], as is irrigation of the Sahara Desert [^24]. Efforts to increase Earth's surface albedo, such as by painting roofs white, would make insignificant contribution [^24]. There are several methods under development that could directly remove greenhouse gases other than CO<sub>2</sub>, but data on their prospects is limited [^16].
