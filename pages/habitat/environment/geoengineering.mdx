# Geoengineering

Geoengineering can refer to any method of deliberately altering the Earth's climate or atmospheric composition. While direct air capture of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere and bioenergy and carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS) can be considered forms of geoengineering, we consider them in our analysis of [carbon capture and sequestration](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/ccs).

## Approaches
Following is a summary of commonly considered geoengineering methods, their estimated costs, carbon removal or mitigation potential, limitations, and risks and drawbacks. See also our analysis of [ocean-based geoengineering](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/oceans/ocean_geoeng).

All proposed methods of geoengineering come with severe risk, limitations, and/or cost, though there is no reason to rule them out *a priori.*

## Solar Geoengineering
Solar geoengineering refers to a method to reduce the sunlight that reaches Earth's surface, such as stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening, and cirrus cloud thinning, and thus inducing cooling [^9]. While these are potentially useful and inexpensive tools, they carry possible unknown risks and do not address the problems of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration or ocean acidification. Modeling and limited field trials are appropriate at this time, but not full scale deployment [^9].

## Other Forms
There are several other methods sometimes discussed but not included above. The use of mirrors in orbit to reflect sunlight is at present impractical [^10], as is irrigation of the Sahara Desert [^24]. Efforts to increase Earth's surface albedo, such as by painting roofs white, would make insignificant contribution [^24]. There are several methods under development that could directly remove greenhouse gases other than CO<sub>2</sub>, but data on their prospects is limited [^16].
