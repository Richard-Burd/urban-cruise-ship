# Air Pollution

Worldwide, pollution is a leading [cause of death](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/habitat/health_socio) and causes substantial economic damage.

## Particulates
Worldwide, particulate pollution is generated across the economy, especially from home combustion of biomass and coal. Forest and savannah fires are the major natural source of particulates.

#### Sources of world particulate emissions as of 2010. Source: Klimont et al. [^8].

As of 2011, particulate air pollution in the United States caused nearly $900 billion in annual damages.

Damages from air pollution depend both on the nature of the pollutant and where it is released; generally, pollutants released in high population density areas do more damage. Following are estimated monetized damage from particulate pollution by source.

## Indoor Air Pollution
Indoor air pollution contributes to 1.6 million [^5] to 2.9 million [^9] deaths per year. The main source of indoor air pollution is cooking, particularly with traditional biofuels in poor countries, and the death toll is trending down with development [^11].

## Acidification
Freshwater and soil acidification are the reduction of pH in water and the soil, a process that harms ecosystems and soil fertility. Acid rain, a form of acidification, further harms ecosystems and buildings. Three main gases--sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and ammonia--are artificial causes of acidification, though some other gases play smaller roles [^10].

#### Data on ammonia and NOx emissions may be unreliable due to age and difficulty of data collection. Sources: NOx from the UN [^18], SO<sub>2</sub> from Dahiya and Myllyvirta [^3], NH3 from Sutton et al. [^15], and acidification potentials from Lindley et al. [^10].

Following are estimates of major sources of sulfur dioxide and ammonia emissions worldwide and nitrogen oxide emissions in the United States.

Due to pollution controls, NOx emissions in the United States [^17], and SO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the United States and China [^3] are trending down.

## Aerosol Loading
Aside from direct impacts on human health, atmospheric aerosols have effects on the climate that are not yet fully understood. Current natural and human-caused aerosol emissions are estimated as follows.

#### Source: Tomasi and Lupi [^16].

Most major classes of aerosols should cause short-term global cooling, by reflecting more sunlight than they absorb. The exception is black carbon, which causes warming [^2]. A major source of uncertainty in the impact of aerosols is in their interaction with cloud formation [^2]. If all aerosols from human activity were to cease, the result would be an estimated 0.5℃ to 1.1℃ global warming and a 2-4.6% increase in precipitation [^13], in contrast to the nearly 1℃ observed since the start of industrialization and 2℃ target set by the Paris Agreement. The cooling effect motivates interest in intentionally releasing aerosols into the upper atmosphere to offset [global warming](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/habitat/climate_socio).

## Air Pollution Removal
Several methods are considered to remove air pollution from the ambient atmosphere. Among them are smog towers, or air purification towers; photocatalysts such as titanium dioxide; or biological methods such as tree planting or living walls [^14].

Titanium dioxide is effective in removing nitrous oxides and volatile organic compounds from the atmosphere, but not carbon monoxide. The use of titanium dioxide coatings on buildings and other urban surfaces does not appear to be cost effective at present [^1]. Research is ongoing into chemical modifications that might be more effective [^12]. Smog towers have been deployed recently in highly polluted cities in India, China, and Poland, and their cost-effectiveness in reducing air pollution is not firmly established [^7].
