# Ozone Layer

The depletion of stratospheric ozone, driven primarily by the presence of chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere, is a significant health risk to human and animal life. The ozone layer has started to recover following the Montreal Protocol of 1987 [^2], which banned many ozone-depleting substances, but full recovery is not expected until around 2070 [^10].

#### Stratospheric ozone is depleted mainly by chorine and bromine. Concentration of these substances peaked in 2000 but remains well above natural levels. Source: Goddard Space Flight Center [^2].

In 2018, the WMO estimated that stratospheric ozone between latitudes 60 &deg; S and 60 &deg; N was 7 Dobson units (DU) below the pre-1970 baseline, above 60 &deg; N was 50 DU below the baseline, and below 60 &deg; S was 100 DU below the baseline [^10]. The total shortfall is about 176 million tons.

## Ozone-Depleting Substance Emissiosn

As of 2016, world emissions of ozone-depleting substances are estimated as follows. Evidence suggests the unreported increase in CFC-11 emissions, which is illegal under the Montreal Protocol, is coming from Eastern China [^8], though more recent data suggests that this unreported source is now decreasing [^6]. See our analysis of the environmental impacts of the space industry for consideration of how increased rocket launches might impact the ozone layer.

#### Major ozone-depleting chemicals and estimated depletion potential from emissions as of 2016 as reported by the Goddard Center [^2], and major sources of emissions as reported by the World Meteorological Association [^10]. Not every ozone-depleting chemical is listed.

Based on a social cost of CFC-11 of $618/kg (2020 dollars) reported in 1992 [^3], current world ozone-depleting emissions from human activity inflict $86-199 billion of damages per year. Separately, the Montreal Protocol has been estimated to prevent $3.9 trillion (2022 dollars) in damages per year from 1987 to 2060 to human health, agriculture, fisheries, and materials [^5].

## Stratospheric Ozone Generation

While the ozone layer will recover on its own if the emission of ozone-depleting substances were to cease, recovery can be accelerated through generation of ozone in the stratosphere, or full concentration can be maintained with generation.

#### Cost, in billions of dollars, of generating the 176 million ton ozone layer shortfall. Costs of ozone generators are based on an industrial ozone generator offered by Spartan Environmental Technologies [^11]. The energy cost is based on Spartan's specs for oxygen-fed system [^11] and a levelized cost of electricity of 22.1 cents/kWh, the upper range of an estimated range for residential rooftop solar [^12]. The lifting cost is based on an analysis of the cost of lifting, via balloons, hydrogen sulfide for solar radiation management [^13]. The price of oxygen is based on NASA's purchases of liquid oxygen for rocket fuel [^14].
