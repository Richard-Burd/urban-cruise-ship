# Population Ethics

One's views on population policy may be influenced by choice of ethical framework. See also our analysis of determinants of fertility and environmental impacts of population.

## Average Versus Total Well-Being
Following are major ethical frameworks in population ethics.

#### A totalism view would generally be more pronatalist than an average utility view. Sources: Hardin [^4], Tännsjö [^10]. Totalism is more commonly held among philosophers [^3].

An ethic centered on totalism may call for raising the population to the Earth's carrying capacity, even if this diminishes the average well-being of all people, a situation that Derek Parfit calls mere addition, or the repugnant conclusion [^6]. Averagism suffers from an opposite paradox, where a member of a group, whose life is good but not as good as the group's average, would cause harm to the group by bringing down the average [^6].

## Value of Existence
While it is generally agreed that a person with high well-being is preferable to a person with low well-being, all else being equal, a challenge for most philosophical systems is the incomparability between nonexistence and existence at any level of well-being. Several attempts to make this comparison are as follows.

#### Source: [^1].

This situation is related to the nonidentity problem, that an action can be bad only if it harms an existing person [^8]. Building from the asymmetric person-affecting view, David Benatar argues a strong antinatalist view and that it would be best for humanity to come to extinction via non-reproduction [^2], a view that has prompted disagreement [^5], [^7], [^9].
