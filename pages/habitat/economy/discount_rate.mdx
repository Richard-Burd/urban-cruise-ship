# Discount Rate

## Discounting and Intergenerational Ethics
Discounting refers to the practice of devaluing money in the future by a percentage, typically 3-7%. At a discount rate of 5%, $5.92 today is worth $1000 100 years from now. Discounting is typically done because it is possible to invest money and expect a long-term return. However, it is also reasonable to value the well-being of a person in the far future equally to a person today.

Harmonizing these two concerns is a difficult problem for which there is no consensus on a solution [^5]. Discounting can make it difficult to deal with long-term environmental challenges, such as climate change.

#### Discount rates can have a large effect on the current valuation of damages done by carbon dioxide, and hence on how much we should be willing to spend to mitigate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Sources: [^2], [^19], [^24]. See also David Roberts' review of discount rates [^20].

Intergenerational ethics call for all policies, not just environmental policies, to be evaulated with low discount rates for the far future. This may mean, for instance, that a higher premium is called for on policies that raise the long-term rate of economic growth and scientific progress [^5].

## Suggested Rates

A survey of economists has found an average recommended social discount rate of 2.27%, and a median of 2%, when considering the far future [^1].
