# Economic Trends

In this section, we consider major broad economic trends. Economic trends inform our expectations of environmental impacts to be expected in the future.

## Technological Advancement
There is evidence that the pace of technological progress is slowing down. For example, Bloom et al. [^3] find that research productivity is falling with semiconductors (Moore's law), agricultural yields, life expectancy, and general technological development. This means that more researchers--41 times more since the 1930s--are required over time to make the same gains. Similar results have been found with machine learning [^2], and in China and Germany [^4] and Japan [^6].

One reason this is happening may be that, as knowledge advances, it becomes more difficult to operate at the frontier of knowledge [^5].

Artificial intelligence may again accelerate the rate of advancement [^1].
