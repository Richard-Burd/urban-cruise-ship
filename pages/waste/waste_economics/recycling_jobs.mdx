# Job Creation

We estimate [the environmental costs](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/waste/landfill_tax) of landfilling and incineration of municipal solid waste, compared to recycling, to be about $100 per ton of material. The economic impact of the recycling industry is much greater.

## Economic Value of Recycling Industry
The gross value of the recycling and remanufacturing industry is hundreds of dollars for every ton of material recycled.

Municipalities have an incentive to finance effective collection systems and advanced material recovery facilities for economic development.
