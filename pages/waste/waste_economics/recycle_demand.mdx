# Demand for Recycling

There must be sufficient demand for recycled material to advance recycling. Manufacturers cite quality and contamination, as well as price, as a limiting factor in the use of recycled plastic [^2]. Recycled paper is more often used for paperboard and corrugated products, but not as such for high quality products such as office paper and magazines [^1].
