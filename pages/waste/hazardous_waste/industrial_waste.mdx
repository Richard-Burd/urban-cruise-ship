## Coal Ash
Coal ash is the byproduct of burning coal, including fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, and flue gas desulfurization material [^6]. Coal ash contains harmful materials, such as arsenic, cadmium, and mercury, and it can cause water and air pollution [^6]. Burning one ton of coal produces about 0.15 tons of ash [^4].

Following spills at Kingston, Tennessee, where at least 30 clean-up workers have died from illnesses suspected to be linked to the spill [^3], and at Eden, North Carolina [^5], the U. S. EPA has instituted regulations on coal ash disposal. The rules requires liners to control water pollution and other safeguards, but it may be inadequate [^1].
