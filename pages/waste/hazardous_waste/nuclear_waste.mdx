# Nuclear Waste

Disposing of nuclear waste is inexpensive relative to the cost of nuclear power, but it is an issue that needs to be resolved.

## Composition and Danger
Most nuclear waste, by volume, is low-level waste, such as contaminated clothing. By radioactivity, most is high-level waste: spent fuel, fission products, and the transuranic elements that result from neutron bombardment of uranium.
