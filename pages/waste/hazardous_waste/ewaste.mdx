# E-Waste

In this section, we examine the problem of electronic waste and some solutions.

## Trends
The generation of e-waste is growing rapidly with the proliferation of consumer electronics, but recycling rates are increasing slowly.

#### Source: [^6]. Recycling rates only count formal collection, and do not count informal recycling, which can result in severe health and environmental problems.

The growth of solar panels and batteries will further contribute to the growth of e-waste as these technologies start to be decomissioned in large quantities.

## Impacts
Improperly disposed e-waste causes significant harm.

#### Sources: the Global E-Waste Monitor [^6] and Boardman et al. [^2]. Health damages are assessed per-tonne for e-waste recycling in Guiyu, southern China, where standards of health and safety are not well followed. The majority of the damage is from lead exposure, with additional costs from other toxic materials in e-waste.

Lead, cadmium, mercury, and other pollutants released by improper e-waste management do substantial harm to the air and soil, but monetized damages of those are not included above.

Failing to recycle e-waste also results in the loss of valuable minerals. The value of the minerals in e-waste is estimated at $62.5 billion per year [^13].

#### Value of minerals in e-waste estimated by [^5], [^6], [^10].

## Recycling Options
E-waste generally costs a bit over $1000/tonne to recycle.

As of 2018, 24 states apply extended producer responsibility, where manufacturers of certain products are required to provide for their proper disposal. The products covered vary by state. Additionally, California charges a fee, which is used to run a recycling program itself, and Colorado bans the disposal of electronic devices at solid waste landfills [^11].

## Solar E-waste
As more solar photovoltaics reach the end of their lives, they will significantly contribute to e-waste. The following may be expected by midcentury.

<div className="table-wrapper">

| Metric | Value  |
| --- | --- |
| Average solar energy production in 2040s | 3950 GW [^15] |
| E-waste from retired solar PV, average per year, 2040-2050 | 4.5-5.6 million tons [^15] |
| Cost per tonne to recycle solar PV | $334.80 [^8] |
| Cost per kWh of panel recycling | 0.015-0.018 ¢/kWh |

</div>

#### The cost of solar PV recycling might be imposed on solar PV manufacturers or utilities. The sales of recovered raw materials might offset the cost of recycling [^8]. The cost per kWh assesses currently existing solar panels in 2040 with the cost of recycling retiring panels, assuming a 30% (ratio of actual production to theoretical maximum production) capacity factor.

## Wind Turbine Blade Disposal
About 80-85% of wind turbines can be recycled [^16], but they are mostly landfilled because turbine blades are generally made of a thermoset plastic that is difficult to recycle [^7]. Recycling blades should require no more than 2% of the energy they create over the lifetime of the wind turbine (assuming a 30% capacity factor) [^4].
