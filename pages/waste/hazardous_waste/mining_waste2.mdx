# Mining Waste

## Tailings by metals
Following are estimates of tailings generated for select metals.

#### Tailings by metal. Sources: [^1], [^6], [^8], [^10], [^11], [^12].

As demand for minerals increases and mining technology improves, lower grade ores become profitable, increasing the tailings per ton harvested. An example of this is in copper in Chile.

## Coal Refuse
Mining one ton of coal creates about 0.4 tons of mining waste, known as coal refuse [^3]. When not reclaimed properly, coal refuse causes unsightly, barren landscapes, water pollution via acid mine drainage, fires, and other problems [^2].

The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 creates two revenue sources for dealing with coal refuse. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation (AML) Fund is used to reclaim mines that closed prior to the SMCRA in 1977, as well as mines operated by companies that went bankrupt. As of 2022, coal miners are assessed a fee of up to 22.4 cents per ton of coal produced [^4]. This translates to about 0.0012 cents/kWh to the cost of coal-fired electricity if the power plant has 30% efficiency. Miners are also required to reclaim land disturbed by mining operations and must post a bond to insure that they can pay for it [^7].

Land reclamation bonds can take the form of surety bonds, collatoral bonds, or self-bonding. Due to the contraction of the coal industry and bankruptcy among miners, self-bonding may be too risky and may result in the public being responsible for reclamation [^7].

It is also possible to burn coal refuse in a coal-fired power plant, but doing so carries most of the environmental costs of other forms of coal power [^9].
