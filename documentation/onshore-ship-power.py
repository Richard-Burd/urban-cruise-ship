# avoided ship generator time was calculated using average berth time multiplied by number of stops at major ports. Research indicated that 50 would be a decent number of port calls per year for a ship, and it seems a reasonable number, so 20 port calls were used for the calculation being that the major ports are very frequently visited. this was multiplied by the number of reccomended berths. I double checked the work and this would result in the berths being occupied 315 days out of the year. Seemed reasonable. 25000 ships were chosen out of the worldwide fleet of 100000. The cost of berths were taken from a case study on this topic, the same one also gave a suggestion for the pricing of refits. all annnualized over the lifetime of the ship or berth, 20 and 30 years, at a 6 percent discount rate.
