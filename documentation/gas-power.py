#currently, avoided gas in the benefit calculation is calculated as the avoided cost of the normal plants. The costs are the costs of the plants with ccus. However, upon review, it does seem a bit convoluted. 
# A possible reworking would be to claim the difference of the more expensive plants as the cost, which is roughly 4.5 billion, and the avoided social carbon costs as 5 billion. This would give a benefit of 500 million. A narrow ratio. 22.19 billion is the cost of the plants with ccus, and 17.69 billion is the cost of the normal plants. So the difference between those two numbers is of 22.2-17.7=4.5 billion. The avoided social carbon costs are 5 billion. So the benefit is 500 million.
# as of today 03/24/2025, i will change the calculations according to the above. -jye
