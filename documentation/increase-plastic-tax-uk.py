# figures for this paper were derived from this paper [Resource The Future: Plastic Packaging Tax | Veolia UK](https://www.veolia.co.uk/pptreport). 
# costs and benefits were converted from british pounds to USD
# the costs were divided over a 10 year period evenly. There may be some sort of math that should be applied here to adjust for net present value.
