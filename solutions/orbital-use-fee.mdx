Every satellite in orbit creates a risk of collision, which is an external cost unless somehow mitigated. An orbital use fee, which charges satellites a fee per year in orbit, it a way to internalize this cost.

Rao, Burgess, and Kaffine propose an orbital use fee that would rise to $235,000 per satellite-year in 2040. Such a policy would create a net present value of $2.4 trillion over all future years [^"22"].

There are several ways in which an orbital use fee could be instituted. It could be agreed through international negotiations, modeled after the Vessel Day Scheme to establish a price floor on the leasing of fishing rights [^"22"]. It could also be implemented in the context of the Outer Space Treaty and the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects [^"22"].

There are still details to establish in an orbital use fee, such as differential rates between large and small satellites [^"22"].

An orbital use fee would have some limitations. It could put developing space programs, that are more cost-sensitive, at a disadvantage [^"4"]. It would also not address legacy debris and debris from anti-satellite tests [^"25"].
