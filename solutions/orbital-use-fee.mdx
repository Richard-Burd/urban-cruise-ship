## Description

## Background

As discussed above, the growing prevalence of satellites for communication, climate monitoring, navigation, and other purposes poses a growing risk of collisions. The expected annual cost of satellite collisions with orbital debris for all orbits was $86-103 million in 2020 [^"1"].

## Calculations

Rao, Burgess, and Kaffine propose an orbital use fee that would rise to $235,000 per satellite-year by 2040, which they assess would add a net present value of $2.4 trillion to the satellite industry [^"22"]. This value is approximately $120 billion per year in perpetuity at the 5% discount rate that they use. We assess costs based on the $235,000 fee, applied to 58,000 satellites in orbit, an estimate of satellite launches from 2022 to 2030 from the U.S. General Accounting Office [^"2"].

We acknowledge great uncertaintly in projecting the future number of satellites, a figure that might be greatly affected by the fee. We have not considered some design questions such as differential fees by satellite size [^"22"].

## Implementation

An orbital use fee could be negotiated indepdently, similar to the Vessel Day Scheme to establish a price floor on the leasing of fishing rights, or it could also be implemented in the context of the Outer Space Treaty and the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects [^"22"].

An orbital use fee imposes disproportionate costs on space programs in low-income countries [^"4"]. It would also not address legacy debris and debris from anti-satellite tests [^"25"], unless the proceeds from the fee are used to develop and implement debris retrieval.
