## Description
We recommend an orbital use fee to mitigate the cost of collisions.

## Background
Every satellite in orbit creates a risk of collision, which is an external cost unless somehow mitigated. An orbital use fee, which charges satellites a fee per year in orbit, is a way to internalize this cost.
The expected annual cost of satellite collisions with orbital debris for all orbits was $86-103 million in 2020[^"1"].

## Calculations
Rao, Burgess, and Kaffine propose an orbital use fee that would rise to $235,000 per satellite-year in 2040. Such a policy would create a net present value of $2.4 trillion over all future years [^"22"].

To try to estimate the cost of enacting an orbital use fee we use the average cost of passing state legislation ($13,625,000) [^”4”] and add the average cost of federal regulations ($11,714,286) [^”5”]. Compliance costs are estimated to average $13,142,857 per regulation annually[^”5”]. Together this equals $38,482,143, multiplied by 195 countries equals $7.5 billion. Adding the cost of an overseeing body such as the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs which has a requested budget of $4.8 million[^”5”], still leaves the total at $7.5 billion.

## Implementation
There are several ways in which an orbital use fee could be instituted. It could be agreed through international negotiations, modeled after the Vessel Day Scheme to establish a price floor on the leasing of fishing rights [^"22"]. It could also be implemented in the context of the Outer Space Treaty and the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects [^"22"].
There are still details to establish in an orbital use fee, such as differential rates between large and small satellites [^"22"].

An orbital use fee would have some limitations. It could put developing space programs, that are more cost-sensitive, at a disadvantage [^"4"]. It would also not address legacy debris and debris from anti-satellite tests [^"25"], unless the proceeds from the fee are used to develop and implement debris retrieval.
