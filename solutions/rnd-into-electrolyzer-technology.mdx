## Description

We recommend more research and development in Electrolyzer technology to address the needs of low-carbon hydrogen production.

## Background
Hydrogen is a versatile energy carrier that has long played a critical role in various industrial processes. Traditionally derived from natural gas (so-called "gray hydrogen"), it is most commonly used in refining petroleum, producing ammonia for fertilizers, and manufacturing methanol. However, as countries seek to decarbonize their economies, low-carbon hydrogen produced through electrolysis—using renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen—is increasingly viewed as a key solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is especially useful in sectors where direct electrification is challenging such as industrial heat, heavy transportation, fertilizer production, and energy storage.

Hydrogen electrolysis technology splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity, and the hydrogen can then be used as a fuel source that emits no carbon. Classes of electrolyzers include:  
 Alkaline electrolyzers (AEL), which use a liquid solution electrolyte. These are commercially mature, have a comparatively low cost, and long operational life. However, they have slower response times, lower current density and face challenges with intermittent renewable integration[^"9"].  
Proton-exchange membrane (or polymer electrolyte membrane) (PEM) electrolyzers, which use a plastic solid electrolyte. These are currently expanding commercially, produce high purity hydrogen, and have fast response times. However, they can be very costly due to using platinum-group metals[^"9”].  
Solid oxide electrolyzers (SOEC), which use a solid ceramic electrolyte. These are currently in pilot stage of production, have high efficiency (can exceed 90%) by using heat and electricity, and are good for industrial integration. However, they require high operating temperatures (700-1000°C) and there are material degradation concerns[^"9"].  
Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM) Electrolyzers are an emerging technology that has a relatively lower cost and flexible operation but requires ongoing development[^"9"].

The United States government has set a hydrogen cost target of $1 per kilogram by 2030 [^"1"].

Current uses for hydrogen, for which low-carbon options are needed, include oil refining, ammonia production, methanol production, and steel production [^"3"]. Despite advances in the efficiency of hydrogen production combined with renewable energy, further research is needed to make renewable production a reality [^"2"].

## Calculations
The current cost for green hydrogen via electrolysis is $4-9/kg[^"11"], [^"12"].

We recommend the goal of getting green hydrogen to $1/kg with 80% Electrolyzer efficiency, which is shared by the [DOE Hydrogen Shot Initiative]( https://www.energy.gov/topics/hydrogen-shot). The U.S. DOE is spending about $370 million a year towards this goal[^"13"].
Replacing 1 kg of gray hydrogen (from natural gas) with green hydrogen avoids about 10 kg CO₂e[^"14"].

The U.S. DOE has set a goal of producing 10 MMT annually of green hydrogen through the [U.S. National Clean Hydrogen Strategy](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/library/roadmaps-vision/clean-hydrogen-strategy-roadmap). That would equate to 100 million tones of CO2e reduced. With an estimated [Social Cost of Carbon](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) set at $141.40 per ton the GHG reduction would amount to a benefit of $14.14 billion annually.

## Implementation
The [Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-and-fuel-cell-technologies-office), [Clean Hydrogen Partnership](https://www.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu/index_en), and [National Renewable Energy Laboratory]( https://www.nrel.gov/) could be involved in furthering this technology.

Governments can accelerate research with direct policy changes, grants, and financial incentives [^"8"]. Example grants include the [U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act]( https://www.gfoa.org/the-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-iija-was), [E.U. Green Deal]( https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en), and [U.S. 45V Hydrogen Production Tax Credit]( https://www.energy.gov/articles/clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-45v-resources). Carbon pricing has been shown to assist in reducing carbon emissions and will encourage further research into Electrolyzer technology [^"7"].

There will need to be clear standards to identify “green hydrogen”. Electrolysis requires a minimum of 9 liters of water per kg of hydrogen produced and other processes in production can use that much or more[^"10"], this can pose issues especially in arid regions.
