## Background
Hydrogen is a versatile energy carrier that has long played a critical role in various industrial processes. Traditionally derived from natural gas (so-called "gray hydrogen"), it is most commonly used in refining petroleum, producing ammonia for fertilizers, and manufacturing methanol. However, as countries seek to decarbonize their economies, low-carbon hydrogen produced through electrolysis—using renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen—is increasingly viewed as a key solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is especially useful in sectors where direct electrification is challenging such as industrial heat, heavy transportation, fertilizer production, and energy storage.

The United States government has set a hydrogen cost target of $1 per kilogram by 2030 [^"1"].

Current uses for hydrogen, for which low-carbon options are needed, include oil refining, ammonia production, methanol production, and steel production [^"3"]. Despite advances in the efficiency of hydrogen production combined with renewable energy, further research is needed to make renewable production a reality [^"2"].

## Calculations
The current cost for green hydrogen via electrolysis is $4-9/kg [^"11"], [^"12"].

We recommend the goal of reducing the cost of green hydrogen to $1/kg with 80% electrolyzer efficiency, as given by the [DOE Hydrogen Shot Initiative]( https://www.energy.gov/topics/hydrogen-shot). The U.S. Department of Energy is spending about $370 million a year towards this goal [^"13"].
Replacing 1 kg of gray hydrogen (from natural gas) with green hydrogen avoids the equivalent of about 10 kg carbon dioxide reductions [^"14"].

The U.S. DOE has also set a goal of producing 10 million tons annually of green hydrogen through the [U.S. National Clean Hydrogen Strategy](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/library/roadmaps-vision/clean-hydrogen-strategy-roadmap), reducing the equivalent of 100 million tones of carbon dioxide. With an estimated [social cost of carbon](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) of $141.40 per ton, the greenhouse gas reduction benefit is $14.14 billion annually.

## Implementation
The [Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-and-fuel-cell-technologies-office), [Clean Hydrogen Partnership](https://www.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu/index_en), and [National Renewable Energy Laboratory]( https://www.nrel.gov/) could be involved in furthering this technology.

Governments can accelerate research with direct policy changes, grants, and financial incentives [^"8"]. Example grants include the [U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act]( https://www.gfoa.org/the-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-iija-was), [E.U. Green Deal]( https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en), and [U.S. 45V Hydrogen Production Tax Credit]( https://www.energy.gov/articles/clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-45v-resources). Carbon pricing has been shown to assist in reducing carbon emissions and will encourage further research into electrolyzers [^"7"].

There will need to be clear standards to identify "green hydrogen". Electrolysis requires a minimum of 9 liters of water per kg of hydrogen produced and other processes in production can use that much or more [^"10"], a potential concern in arid regions.
