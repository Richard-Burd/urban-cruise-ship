## Description

We recommend more research and development in Electrolyzer technology to address the needs of low-carbon hydrogen.

## Background

Regardless of how much a broader hydrogen economy advances, there is a need for low-carbon hydrogen for existing uses, and this entails research and development into electrolyzers. Hydrogen electrolysis technology splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity. The Hydrogen can then be used as a fuel source that emits no carbon. There are various types:[^"1"]
- Alkaline Electrolyzers use a liquid solution electrolyte[^"1"]
- Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) Electrolyzers use a plastic solid electrolyte[^"1"]
- Solid Oxide Electrolyzers use a solid ceramic electrolyte at high temperatures[^"1"]

Governments, including the United States, have set a hydrogen cost target of $1/kg by 2030.[^"1"]

Regardless of how much a broader hydrogen economy advances, there is a need for low-carbon hydrogen for existing uses such as oil refining, ammonia production, methanol production, and steel production.[^"3"]

Hydrogen could serve as a fuel source for aviation, shipping, heating, and power generation.[^"3"] 

Despite advances in the efficiency of hydrogen production combined with renewable energy, further research is needed to make renewable production a reality.[^"2"]

## Implementation

Governments can accelerate research with direct policy changes, grants, and financial incentives.[^"8"]

Carbon pricing has been shown to assist in reducing carbon emissions and will encourage further research into electrolyzer technology[^"7"]
