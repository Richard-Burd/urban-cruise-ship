## Description

We recommend more research and development in Electrolyzer technology to address the needs of low-carbon hydrogen.

## Background

Regardless of how much a broader hydrogen economy advances, there is a need for low-carbon hydrogen for existing uses, and this entails research and development into electrolyzers. Hydrogen electrolysis technology splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity, and the hydrogen can then be used as a fuel source that emits no carbon. Classes of electrolyzers include alkaline electrolyzers, which use a liquid solution electrolyte; proton-exchange membrane (or polymer electrolyte membrane) electrolyers, which use a plastic solid electrolyte; and solid oxide electrolyzers, which use a solid ceramic electrolyte.

The United States government has set a hydrogen cost target of $1 per kilogram by 2030 [^"1"].

Current uses for hydrogen, for which low-carbon options are needed, include oil refining, ammonia production, methanol production, and steel production [^"3"]. Despite advances in the efficiency of hydrogen production combined with renewable energy, further research is needed to make renewable production a reality [^"2"].

## Implementation

Governments can accelerate research with direct policy changes, grants, and financial incentives [^"8"]. Carbon pricing has been shown to assist in reducing carbon emissions and will encourage further research into electrolyzer technology [^"7"].
