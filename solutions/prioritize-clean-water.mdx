## Description

Development agencies should prioritize access to clean water. We examine various economical disinfection techniques capable of reducing pollutants to acceptable limits.

## Background
Approximately 2.2 billion people globally lack safely managed drinking water services, of these around 703 million people lacked even a basic drinking water service, defined as access to an improved water source within a 30-minute round trip [^"3"].

Unsafe drinking water is attributed to waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid which led to over 1.2 million deaths annually[^"4"]. Lack of clean water and sanitation costs some countries up to 6% of their GDP due to health care costs and productivity losses[^"5"],[^"6"]. Children, especially girls, often miss school to collect water, leading to educational deficiencies[^"3"].

Following is a list of the most prominent options to address this issue:  
•	Point-of-Use Filtration: Low-cost filters like ceramic or biosand filters (~$20–$50 per household) that remove bacteria and protozoa.  
Slow sand filtration, also known as biosand filtration can be used to significantly reduce the presence of pathogens and pollutants. It involves filtering the contaminated water through a bed of sand and gravel. In 14 to 30 days, a biological layer (known as a schutzedecke) forms which increases the efficacy of the filter. However, there is still a need for further treatment before the water can be guaranteed to be potable, as the biosand filter is not as effective at microbe removal[^"1"].  
Ceramic filtration has shown promise as a low cost option. A ceramic filter made using traditional slip-casting techniques in sub-Saharan Africa achieved 99.99% bacterial removal[^"2"].  
The Terafil water filter is composed of red clay, sand, and wood sawdust. It can handle 1,500 Liters per hour with a life span of five years. It can treat ground and surface water[^"1"].  
Tata Swach® water purifiers cost around $12 per 3,000 liters of potable water[^"1"].

•	Solar Water Disinfection (SODIS): Using PET bottles and sunlight, this method is almost cost-free but requires awareness and training.  
(SODIS), also called solar pasteurization, is a simple and effective method for water disinfection. It involves exposing water in clear plastic or glass containers to direct sunlight for several hours. Problems of this method include inefficiency, which have been addressed by using additives that can accelerate the process. Such additives include hydrogen peroxide, copper, lemon, lime, and vinegar. The efficiency has also been improved by concentrating sunlight[^"1"].  
•	Rainwater Harvesting Systems: Particularly effective in rural or drought-prone regions; system cost varies between $100–$1,000 per household.

## Calculations
Basic water needs are estimated to require 50 liters per person/day[^"7"], or 18.25 cubic meters per year. To service those 703 million without basic drinking water services that would require about 12.8 billion cubic meters annually. Assuming a weighted average cost of the above methods at $1 per m³ to provide treated water would equal $12.8 billion.

It is estimated that every $1 invested in water and sanitation yields around $4.30 in economic returns through avoided medical costs, increased productivity, and fewer sick days[^"8"]. That would equal a benefit of $55 billion annually.

## Implementation
Large funding organizations such as [UNICEF]( https://www.un.org/en/ccoi/unicef-united-nations-childrens-fund), [WHO]( https://www.who.int/), [Water.org](https://water.org/), [The World Bank]( https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home), and [The Gates Foundation]( https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) will need to cooperate with local governments and NGO’s such as [charity: water]( https://www.charitywater.org/the-spring/direct), [WaterAid]( https://www.wateraid.org/us/), and [Global Water Challenge](https://globalwaterchallenge.org/) to implement this solution at the local community level.

These water systems will need to have continued maintenance, this can be accomplished by training locals, however there will most likely need to be recurring checks to make sure the systems are continuing to operate successfully.
