## Description

Development agencies should prioritize access to clean water. We examine various economical disinfection techniques capable of reducing pollutants to acceptable limits.

## Background

Solar Disinfection (SODIS), also called solar pasteurization, is a simple and effective method for water disinfection. It involves exposing water in clear plastic or glass containers to direct sunlight for several hours. Problems of this method include inefficiency, which have been addressed by using additives that can accelerate the process. Such additives include hydrogen peroxide, copper, lemon, lime, and vinegar. The efficiency has also been improved by concentrating sunlight[^"1"].

Slow sand filtration, also known as biosand filtration can be used to significantly reduce the presence of pathogens and pollutants. It involves filtering the contaminated water through a bed of sand and gravel. In 14 to 30 days, a biological layer (known as a a schutzedecke) forms which increases the efficacy of the filter. However, there is still a need for further treatment before the water can be guaranteed to be potable, as the biosand filter is not as effective at microbe removal[^"1"].

Ceramic filtration has shown promise as a low cost option. A ceramic filter made using traditional slip-casting techniques in sub-Saharan Africa achieved 99.99% bacterial removal[^"2"]. 

The Terafil water filter is composed of red clay, sand, and wood sawdust. It can handle 1,500 Liters per hour with a life span of five years. It can treat ground and surface water[^"1"].

Tata SwachÂ® water purifiers cost around $12 per 3,000 liters of potable water[^"1"].
