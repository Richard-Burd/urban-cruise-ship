## Description


We recommend that the European Union ban all bottom-contact fishing in European Marine Protected Areas, an area of 556,489 km².

## Background


There have been reports of fishery declines due to bottom trawling since the 1400s. A petition in the British Parliament in 1376 notes a degradation of fisheries following the use of these devices, “That whereas in several places within your said realm, in creeks and havens of the sea, where was accustomed before these times to be a good and plenteous fishery is in part destroyed and rendered valueless…” [^"6"]


While it targets shrimp, hake, mullet, anglerfish, and octopus, a ban on bottom trawling in the EU would only have a limited impact human diets, as many of the target species such as sand eels, sprat, and blue whiting are used in the production of fish oil and feed for aquaculture. [^"15"]

In the EU, bottom trawling:
- Accounts for 32% (7.3 million tons) of fishing in the EU. [^"11"]
- Accounts for 93% of all bycatch by any fishing means. [^"11"]
- Discarded 1 million tons of dead or dying fish from 2015 to 2019. [^"11"]
- Disturbs 162,899 km² of MPA-designated seafloor [^"1"]

Globally, Bottom trawling releasesover one billion tons of CO₂ into the atmosphere per year due to disturbances of the sea floor and the destruction of critical habitats.[^"3"] In 2022, The UK banned trawling in 4 of their own MPAs. [^"13"]

## Implementation

The EU would need the cooperation of national fisheries authorities, as well as monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new rules. The ban would need to be implemented gradually, with appropriate support provided to affected communities and industries. The process would need to be carefully managed to ensure that the ban achieves its intended environmental goals while minimizing the social and economic impacts on coastal communities. [^"12"]
