## Description

We propose the use of blockchain to address transparency issues with regards to Renewable Energy Credits[^"11"], and to extend the RECs to account for the needs for load balancing.

## Background


Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are tradable certificates that represent the environmental attributes or benefits of renewable energy generation. When renewable energy is produced, it is mixed with energy from other sources, making it difficult to determine which electricity is renewable. RECs solve this problem by allowing the environmental benefits of renewable energy to be separated and traded as a separate commodity[^"4"]. However, RECs face criticism of not always being transparent about their accounting[^"2"]. With many companies claiming to switch to renewable energy through the purchase of cheap clean energy certificates without buying physical wind or solar power[^"3"], it becomes more vital to ensure RECs represent what they claim to. Otherwise, companies will appear to be more progress towards sustainability targets than they actually are[^"2"].


REC trading platforms are often centralized and can be prone to security breaches, lack transparency, and are not always scalable to handle large volumes of trading[^"5"]. Properly tracing the origin of energy to ensure a credible chain of custody introduces significant administrative burdens, with centralized regulatory bodies being responsible for oversight on the creation, transfer, and cancellation of RECs so that double counting is prevented[^"8"].
One of the key advantages of using blockchain for RECs is its decentralized nature, which eliminates the need for intermediaries and provides greater transparency and accountability in the trading process[^"1"].

Blockchain technology utilizes tokens which are a digital representation of something else. This could be currency, a commodity, an asset, or, in this case, a certain amount of renewable energy. This tokenization simplifies the REC trading process and also addresses significant challenges such as double counting and fraud[^"7"].


## Implementation

The application of blockchain in renewable energy procurement and the verification of RECs faces challenges, including the need for significant technological and regulatory adaptation to ensure its successful integration into existing energy markets[^"6"].

Blockchain can present an opportunity for democratized energy production. Care must be taken that the system can function in a fair an equitable manner. Regulations, such as California’s Electric Rule 21, require that customers who use energy-generating equipment give access to the equipment to utility providers without providing compensation to the owners of the equipment[^"9"].

Frameworks that address the operational and transactional issues faced by blockchain are critical to the implementation[^"10"]. 

If a particular electricity consumer attains "100% renewable energy" by purchasing RECs, it is not necessary for that consumer to handle energy storage or other load balancing tools that would be required in a truly 100% renewable electric grid. We also propose extensions to RECs that would account for the need for load balancing.
