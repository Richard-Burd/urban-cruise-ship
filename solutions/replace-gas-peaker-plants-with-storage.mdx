## Description
We recommend replacing fossil fuel based peaker plants with battery storage systems.

## Background

Natural gas is fairly inexpensive in North America, has half the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal, and relatively little other forms of air pollution. It is more difficult to make a case for replacing all gas with low-carbon sources. Peaker plants are designed to be able to ramp up and down quickly, and they tend to be less efficient and more expensive than more common combined cycle plants.

Peaker plants are power plants that operate during periods of high electricity demand. Typically powered by oil or natural gas, they provide a crucial service in maintaining grid reliability, however, they also emit more CO2 when compared to base load plants. [^"1"]


In the United States, two-thirds of peaker plants are situated in low-income communities. When the days are hot and air quality is already impacted, peakers are needed to meet increased energy demands, thereby worsening air quality.[^"3"]


Battery storage systems store electricity from the grid when demand is low and release it when demand is high. They can be charged by any energy source, including renewable power.[^"1"] 
- Can be charged by any energy source, including renewable energy[^"1"]
- Less power is wasted[^"1"]
- Response time is faster than peaker plants[^"1"]

#### Source. [^"6"] [^"8"]

We restrict the scope to the US for the calculations here. Avoided CO2 emissions are the sum total of emissions annually from US peaker plants [^"8"]. We calculated the amount of power produced by these plants to determine how much would be needed in terms of PV plus storage[^"6"] to replace their capacity. [^"8"]

We use the LCOE for peakers from lazard, and calculate the [social carbon cost](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e). Battery storage systems are calculated for their emission totals which are subtracted from the avoided emission totals.
