## Description
We recommend replacing fossil fuel based peaker plants with battery storage systems.

## Background

Natural gas is fairly inexpensive in North America, has half the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal, and relatively little other forms of air pollution. Peaker plants are designed to be able to ramp up and down quickly, and they tend to be less efficient and more expensive than the more common combined cycle plants.

Peaker plants are power plants that operate during periods of high electricity demand. Typically powered by oil or natural gas, they provide a crucial service in maintaining grid reliability, however, they also emit more CO2 when compared to base load plants. [^"1"]

In the United States, two-thirds of peaker plants are situated in low-income communities. When the days are hot and air quality is already impacted, peakers are needed to meet increased energy demands, thereby worsening air quality.[^"3"]


Battery storage systems store electricity from the grid when demand is low and release it when demand is high. They can be charged by any energy source, including renewable power.[^"1"] 
- Can be charged by any energy source, including renewable energy[^"1"]
- Less power is wasted[^"1"]
- Response time is faster than peaker plants[^"1"]

It is important to examine the embedded emissions of battery storage systems. Batteries come with their own set of environmental impacts.
- Extraction involves intensive mining [^"9"]
-- Open-pit mining clears away vegetation, increases erosion, and can contaminate local areas posing health hazards to surrounding plants, animals, and people[^"9"]
-- Brine extraction is a water intensive process using between anywhere between 400 and 2 million liters of water per kilo of lithium[^"11"], and the toxic chemicals used in the processing of lithium can leach into the surrounding area[^"9"]

Embedded emissions can also range widely due to the energy source, location, and other factors, ranging from 104 to 407 kg per MWh. [^"6"] In our scenario, we pair the storage system with Solar Photovoltaic energy source, and we reccomend renewable energy sources in all cases. Efficient battery storage systems can have the effect of increasing emissions if high-emitting plants are used to charge them.[^"6"]

We calculate costs using a Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of Battery Storage with Solar Photovoltaic[^"2"] mulitplied by the reported annual TWh of all peaker plants in the U.S.[^"8"]

Benefits come in the form of avoided expendiatures on natural gas peaker energy costs, which range from $115 to $221 per megawatt hour (MWh)[^"2"]. This is compared to a combination of solar PV power plus battery storage, ranging from $110 to $131 per MWh[^"2"]
Avoided CO₂ emissions are the reported total of peaker emissions annually[^"8"] minus the average embedded emissions of battery storage.[^"6"]

## Implementation

Battery storage is a neccesary part of reducing emissions, however, the technology itself has a significant human and environmental impact. The E.U. has implemented policies for battery collection, however this could incentivise companies to return batteries prior to their end of life. More effort is needed on reuse and recycling prior to production, so that batteries are designed in a way that the materials can be salvaged.[^"12"]
