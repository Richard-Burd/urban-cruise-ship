## Description
We promote education and adoption of the practice of no-till farming and estimate the costs and benefits of x hectares of land switching from conventional tillage to continual no-tillage farming.


## Background
Soil erosion is nearly eliminated by the practice of no-tillage farming[^”1”]. Crop yields stay the same or can be even higher[^”1”].

Benefits include soil erosion mitigation, improved air quality, soil moisture retention, and increased soil biodiversity[^”2”].

By switching to no-till farming, farmers reduce diesel fuel use by 1.6 gallons per hectare[^”3”].

Farmers save 2.7 hours of work for every 100 hectares of land switched to no-till farming[^”3”].


## Calculations
Reduced energy input of corn by 7% and soybeans by 18%[^”1”].

No-till Farming was found to have a higher gross margin of $18/ha/year[^”2”]:

## Implementation
An informational advocacy campaign would run to promote no till farming along with a program to train farmers in the practice.
