## Description
We propose education and adoption of the practice of no-till farming and estimate with a target of an additional 155 million hectares under no-tillage.

## Background
Tillage, the mechanical agitation of soil using plows, discs, or harrows, is a long-standing agricultural practice intended to prepare soil for planting, control weeds, and incorporate crop residues and fertilizers. However, decades of conventional tillage have led to numerous environmental and agronomic problems. Tillage breaks up soil structure, leading to wind and water erosion [^"4"]. It leads to a loss of soil organic carbon due to the decomposition of organic matter leading to long-term fertility reduction and contributing to atmospheric CO₂ levels [^"5"]. Repeated tillage leads to compacted layers below the surface, impeding root growth and reducing water infiltration.

No-till farming eliminates or drastically reduces mechanical soil disturbance, instead using crop residues, cover crops, and direct seeding to maintain soil health. Soil erosion is nearly eliminated by the practice of no-tillage farming [^"1"]. Crop yields stay the same or can be even higher [^"1"]. Benefits include soil erosion mitigation, increased soil organic matter, improved air quality, soil moisture retention, and increased soil biodiversity [^"2"].

## Calculations
As of 2014, approximately 155 million hectares of cropland were under no-till cultivation [^"6"]. With 1.573 billion hectares of cropland globally [^"7"], our goal our goal is to double the amount of no-till cropland bringing no-till cropland close to 20% of the total.

Training and conversion assistance would cover training, technical support, direct seeders, and possibly subsidies for cover crops and to ameliorate any losses during the transition years. While crop yields tend to drop slightly during transition years, they quickly surpass tillage farming and continue to increase long term [^"10"], [^"11"], [^"12"].

No-till farming was found to have a higher gross margin of $18/ha/year [^"2"], and reduced energy input of corn by 7% and soybeans by 18% [^"1"], or a savings of 6.1 liters of diesel fuel per hectare [^"3"]. Farmers save 2.7 hours of work for every 100 hectares of land switched to no-till farming [^"3"]. Furthermore, soil erosion was found to be reduced by 90% [^"13"]; soil erosion has been estimated to cost $44 billion per year in the United States [^"14"].

## Implementation
We support scaled outreach programs similar to past conservation agriculture programs in Africa and Latin America [^"8"],[^"9"].

[The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)]( https://www.fao.org/home/en) of the United Nations would be the main organization to implement this solution with cooperation from the World Bank and National Agricultural Ministries. Academic Institutions and extension services may be helpful in developing courses and training farmers. Short-term yield drops, equipment costs, and cultural resistance may be barriers to adoption of no-till farming.
