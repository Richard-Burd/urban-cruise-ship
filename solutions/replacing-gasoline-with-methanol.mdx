For high methanol blends, as high as M-100 (100% methanol fuel), it is necessary to upgrade the engines of automobiles to use them, similar to flex-fuel engines for high ethanol blends. The cost of doing so, CP-adjusted to 2020, is estimated from [^"22"]. Though not as favorable as a low blend in the broader gasoline supply, a dedicated methanol fleet of cars shows a positive return on investment.

#### Estimated costs and benefits of a 1000 car fleet using pure methanol fuel. Most costs and benefits are as in the above methanol blending estimate, with the costs of engine upgrades estimated by Sheehy et al. [^"22"].

Due to the lower [energy density](/energy/energy_priorities/transportation-energy-efficiency) of methanol, it may make more sense to deploy a methanol fleet among cars that will make frequent, short trips, such as mail trucks, taxis, or delivery vehicles.
