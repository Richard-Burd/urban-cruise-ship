## Description

We propose converting fleets of frequent short-trip vehicles such as mail trucks, taxis, and delivery vehicles to methanol fuel.

## Background

Due to the lower [energy density](/energy/transport/transpo_ghg#transportation-energy-efficiency) of methanol, it makes more sense to deploy a methanol fleet among cars that will make frequent, short trips, such as mail trucks, taxis, or delivery vehicles.
For high methanol blends, as high as M-100 (100% methanol fuel), it is necessary to upgrade the engines of automobiles to use them, similar to flex-fuel engines for high ethanol blends. Though not as favorable as a low blend in the broader gasoline supply, a dedicated methanol fleet of cars shows a positive return on investment.

## Calculations

Engine upgrading costs for a 1,000 car fleet are estimated at $580,000 million [^"1"], where reduction of greenhouse gases is estimated to save $470,000 and have $1.71 million in financial benefits.

## Implementation

The perception of methanol to policy makers could be a barrier at federal regulatory agencies for widespread adoption, however perceptions have been improving recently and are more favorable.

The greatest challenge is fuel price. As a blending additive, methanol will be priced against ethanol and other fuel additives on a volume basis, while as a full fuel, methanol will compete with gasoline and diesel at pump prices on an energy basis [^"1"]. The full fuel option is less expensive, but if both options go forward, the price may settle in the middle [^"1"]. For full methanol fuel, there is a need need for some changes or improvements to fueling infrastructure for delivery of methanol fuel [^"1"].
