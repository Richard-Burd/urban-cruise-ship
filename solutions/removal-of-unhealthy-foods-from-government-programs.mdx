## Description

Certain types of food, such as red meat, contribute to obesity and other health problems. Such foods should be removed from all government food programs, such as [school lunches](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/matter/diet/diet_health#national-school-lunch-program-meat-removal-u-s).

## Background

National dietary guidelines should be updated to predominately plant-based diets to reduce diet-related premature deaths, illness, and environmental impacts [^"3"]. Nutrients affect brain function [^"4"], and low-budget processed meals negatively affect educational outcomes [^"5"]. Diets high in red meat have been correlated with increases in disease and death with the World Health Organization labeling red meat as a Group 2A carcinogen [^"2"].

Research has shown that dietary changes to a predominantly plant-based diet that incorporates evidence-based healthy reduce environmental impacts, improving nutrient deficiencies, and reduce diet-related mortality [^"3"]. A study in Sweden showed that plant-based diets have been shown to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30-52%, land use by 20-45%, and freshwater use by 14-27 [^"1"]. On a global scale, replacing animal-sourced products with plant-based foods would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 84% [^"3"]. An overview of environmental impacts of diet choices can be found here: [Diet Choices - Environmental Impacts](https://JyeHarrisonartstudio.com/ucs-images/diet_choices_environmental.pdf) and [Ethical Impacts](https://JyeHarrisonartstudio.com/ucs-images/diet_choices_ethical.pdf).



## Implementation

The US has had success in reforming school lunch programs [^"8"] , and although the Trump administration rolled back Obama-era progress [^"7"], the Biden administration announced $943 million in additional funding to school food programs in 2022 [^"7"]. Removal of meat from government food programs could encourage wider adoption of plant based alternatives, along with a [plant-based advocacy campaign](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/matter/diet/diet_fw#plant-based-informational-advocacy-campaign).
