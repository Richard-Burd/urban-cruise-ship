The Sabatier reaction is developing method for converting carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with energy input, into methane and water [^"43"]. A more affordable process could help reduce the use of natural gas in heating, cement [^"3"] and other industry, and other terrestrial applications [^"23"], and it may provide another energy storage option [^"33"].

Further refinement on the International Space Station [^"11"] or on Mars [^"17"] will help the development of this process.
