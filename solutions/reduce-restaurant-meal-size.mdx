## Background

People often eat what is put in front of them, and it can be difficult for a person to stop eating even past the point that their body feels full[^"4"]. Plate size has also been shown to affect the amount eaten by 17
%[^"7"].

In the United States, subsidies have decreased food prices, and have encouraged companies to increase serving sizes in order to increase profits.[^"8"]

Portion size and meal frequency are the primary determiners of caloric intake, and there is a direct association between portion size and obesity.[^"1"] Decreased portion size studies show that reducing portions could be effective in reducing unneeded food consumption.[^"5"] 

## Calculations
Reducing portion sizes are estimated to avert 2.41 million tons of food waste, and save 1.14 trillion gallons of water[^"9"].

The costs primarily come from the work needed to determine appropriate portion sizes along with retraining[^"9"].

## Implementation

 Restaurants may be reluctant to reduce sizes due to consumer perceptions of decreased value. The cost of food averages 30% of the total expenses for a restaurant and so offering larger portion sizes can be a relatively inexpensive option to increase the perceived value of a meal. However, when a consumer perceives a high quality food, the amount they are willing to pay rises when the portion is reduced. The idea of increased quantity affecting perceived value only holds true when a consumer sees the quality as low. [^"3"]

A public health campaign highlighting the need for reduced portion size may also be helpful for improving health, and reducing food waste.
