## Description

We propose that states establish recycled content procurement mandates to the extent that they are financially feasible, with the goal to increase total national paper recycling to 75%.

## Background

In recent years, several countries [^"11"] and U.S. states [^"10"] have established recycled content mandates, requiring that a portion of the manufacturing of certain products use recycled materials.

Recycling of paper in the United States is about 38% [^"1"], which, while high, is well below the highest rates of recycling in the world [^"2"]. Fibers degrade in the recycling process, which places a practical limit of five to seven recyclings for given fibers [^"12"]. Thus 100% paper recycling is not possible.

## Calculations

As of 2019, the United States managed about 110 million tonnes of paper and cardboard waste, of which 38% was recycled, 56% was landfilled, and 6% was incinerated [^"1"]. The highest national paper recycling rate in the world is Germany at 75% [^"2"], leaving a potential to increase American recycling rates by 19%.

An estimated $4 billion of material value in paper is lost to landfilling, and tipping fees are another $4 billion.

Based on some lifecycle environmental impact estimates [^"3"] of paper recycling, we estimate the following annual benefits of bringing U.S. paper recycling to the world national maximum.

- $2 billion of value recovered,
- 239 petajoules of energy saved,
- 19 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reduced,
- 873 million cubic meters of water saved,
- 7 million tons of solid waste saved,
- 1850 square kilometers of forest land saved, based on 1600 trees per hectare [^"4"] and a lifespan of harvested trees of 60 years [^"5"].

The cost of recycling paper, as opposed to the use of virgin fibers, varies and is often [^"7"], though not always [^"6"], more expensive. We are not able to present a reliable estimate of the cost of increasing the use of recycled fibers.

## Implementation

In addition to price, quality of recycled fibers and contamination are issues that may limit recyclability and the suitable range of products for recycled paper [^"8"]. If the use of recycled content is driven by mandates, then there is a risk that a mandate for recycled material in one product will cannibalize the market, as opposed to driving more recycling, and divert the use of recycled material from products for which it is more useful [^"9"].
