## Description

We propose research and development into solar heating technologies, which could provide a cost-effective solution for various low-temperature heating needs detailed above, and we recommend world governments explore options for encouraging the adoption of existing solar heating technologies into the industrial sector.

#### Cost estimates for global implementation of solar heat for industry could not be produced at this time. Estimated benefits were produced by scaling the China study of 2% implementation to global industry, and assuming an average of 35% industrial energy demand instead of China's 70%. Source [^"3"] [^"7"].

## Background

The industrial sector utilizes 25% of global heat energy [^"1"], however solar heat only provides 0.02% of industrial heating needs [^"1"]. Over half of the industrial heating needs can easily be covered by solar concentrating systems, which are capable of providing heat up to 400 °C[^"1"]. Solar energy technologies that directly provide heat have a higher conversion efficiency compared to solar electricity generation, and stand out amongst other forms of renewable energy sources in terms of potential [^"2"]. 

Solar heat for industrial processes (SHIP) has been deployed successfully in many places across the world [^"3"]. A study in Mexico has shown that solar heat deployment could cut greenhouse gas emissions by half in the food and beverage sector for the country [^"4"]. Globally, solar heat has potential in a wide range of industries. Due to the wide range of technologies and sectors to which it could be introduced, it is difficult to calculate a reliable estimate of the total costs, but these technologies have been shown to be feasible economic solutions and would decrease global emissions [^"5"].

Estimates show that current solar heat technology could easily meet 2% of China's industrial heat needs, leading to 98.22 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction annually [^"3"]. China's industrial sector represents 70% of their energy consumption [^"3"], whereas other industrialized countries such as the United States have smaller relative industrial sectors[^"7"].

## Implementation

Solar heating integration is a complex process often requiring specialized technicians to perform the analysis necessary to determine whether solar heating would be a viable option. This difficulty in assessing the feasibilty of using this technology is a deterrent to its use. Providing better tools, subsidizing the assessment, and providing education about the viability of solar heating technologies could increase their market penetration [^"1"].
