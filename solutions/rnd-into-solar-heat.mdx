## Description

We propose research and development into solar heating technologies, which could provide a cost-effective solution for various low-temperature heating needs detailed above, and we recommend national governments explore options for encouraging the adoption of existing solar heating technologies into the industrial sector.

## Background

Industrial uses comprise 25% of global heat energy, of which solar heat provides 0.02% [^"1"]. Over half of industrial heat demand falls in the temperature range of current solar technology, with concentrating systems capable of providing heat up to 400 °C [^"1"]. Direct solar heat has a higher conversion efficiency than heat from solar electricity generation, and thus they show more potential than other forms of renewable heat [^"2"].

## Calculations

Solar heat for industrial processes has been deployed successfully in many places across the world [^"3"]. A study in Mexico has shown that solar heat deployment could cut greenhouse gas emissions by half in the food and beverage sector for the country [^"4"]. Due to the wide range of technologies and sectors to which it could be introduced, it is difficult to calculate a reliable estimate of the total costs, but these technologies have been shown to be feasible economic solutions and would decrease global emissions [^"5"]. Estimates show that current solar heat technology could currently meet 2% of China's industrial heat needs, leading to 98.22 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction annually [^"3"].

#### See [Cost of Industrial Heat by Source](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/industry/industrial_heat). Estimates derived from an International Renewable Energy Association (IRENA) projection [^"14"], [^"7"].

We estimate the median of solar heat costs to be $16.78 per megawatt-hour, compared to $3.50/MWh for natural gas, underscoring the need for further research and development of solar heating. Although specific use cases have shown economic gains [^"5"], most benefit to solar heat lies with decreased emissions.

## Implementation

Solar heating integration is a complex process often requiring specialized technicians to perform the analysis necessary to determine whether solar heating is a viable option. This difficulty in assessing the feasibilty of using this technology is a deterrent to its use. Providing better tools, subsidizing the assessment, and providing education about the viability of solar heating technologies could increase their market penetration [^"1"].
