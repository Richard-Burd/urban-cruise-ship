## Description
Cities should add dedicated micromobility lanes, for motorized scooters, e-bikes, and microcars, in high density areas.

## Background
The global e-bike market is growing at a compound annual growth rate of 9%[^”1”]. The global shared bike and scooter market is growing at a compound annual growth rate of 19%[^”1”]. 

In the United States, 2 to 2.5 e-scooter-related injuries per 10,000 trips were reported[^”2”]. Around 24% of incidents are on or caused by a rider’s incorrect use of road infrastructure[^”2”]. Around 8% of all e-scooter crashes that result in injury, a pedestrian is the injured party[^”2”]. 56% of surveyed pedestrians said they felt unsafe walking on sidewalks where e-scooters are being driven[^”2”]. 

72% of e-scooter rider’s noted a preference for driving on cycling infrastructure[^”2”].


## Calculations


## Implementation
40% of self-reporting sidewalk riding e-scooter users indicated a preference of comfort and convenience as to where they ride[^”2”]. This would indicate that the comfort and ease of the rider should be considered when designing micro-mobility lanes.
