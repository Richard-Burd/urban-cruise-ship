## Description


We propose worldwide taxation of antibiotics for livestock as a policy intervention to mitigate the depletion of antibiotic effectiveness that results from extensive antibiotic usage.


## Background


The use of antibiotics causes positive effects by limiting the spread of antibiotic-treatable infections, while also causing negative effects by increasing the number of treatment-resistant infections. Treatment-resistant infections cost the United States alone 23,000 lives and $20 Billion annually[^"2"].


In 2019, it was estimated that bacterial Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was associated with 4.95 million deaths, including 1.27 million deaths directly attributed[^"6"]. Animal agriculture is a major contributor to AMR, with 73% of all antimicrobials used being used in food-producing animals[^"1"].


The sensitivity of bacteria can be considered a finite natural resource[^"5"].

## Benefits


Reducing antibiotic use in livestock could also have other health benefits, such as reducing the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections in humans who eat meat.


Based on the available evidence, the net benefits of taxing antibiotics in livestock are likely to be positive. The potential savings from reduced antibiotic use and the health benefits of mitigating AMR are likely to outweigh the economic costs[^"1"].





## Costs

This taxation results in a 50% increase in the cost of antibiotics for food-producing animals. The primary economic cost of taxing antibiotics in livestock is the increase in the cost of production for livestock producers. This cost increase would likely be passed on to consumers in the form of higher meat prices[^"1"].









## Implementation


Target the tax to specific antibiotic classes. This would allow for more targeted reductions in antibiotic use and could focus resources on the most important antibiotic classes to target. Revenue from the tax can support research and development of new antibiotics. Any tax will need to be flexible and allow for modification as more data emerges about the present state of AMR[^"1"].
