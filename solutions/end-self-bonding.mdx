Coal miners are required to post a bond to pay for the eventual reclamation of the land they disturb. Three types of bonds are surety bonds, which are guaranteed by a third party; collateralized bonds; and self-bonds, which are based on a strong bond rating by a miner. Of $10.2 billion outstanding bonds as of 2018, about 12%, or $1.2 billion, were self-bonds [^"7"].

However, the decline of the coal industry has caused an increase in bankruptcies and non-performance of self-bonds, leaving the rest of society on the hook for reclamation [^"7"]. Therefore, we propose that self-bonds no longer be accepted, and that all reclamation bonds be surety or collateralized. Wyoming has greatly restricted self-bonding in recent years [^"5"].
