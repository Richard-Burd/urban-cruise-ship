## Description
We propose that reclamation self-bonds no longer be accepted, and instead be surety bonds or collateralized bonds.

## Background
Coal miners are required to post a bond to pay for the eventual reclamation of the land they disturb. Three types of bonds are surety bonds, which are guaranteed by a third party; collateralized bonds; and self-bonds, which are based on a strong bond rating by a miner. 

The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement [OSMRE]( https://www.osmre.gov/) uses fees collected from mining operations to provide grants to states and tribes to reclaim abandoned sites[^"2"]. OSMRE also transfers funds to the United Mine Workers of America [UMWA]( https://umwa.org/) which can use the fund for health and retirement accounts, operating expenses, and emergencies[^"2"].

The decline of the coal industry has caused an increase in bankruptcies and non-performance of self-bonds, leaving the rest of society on the hook for reclamation [^"7"]. Wyoming has greatly restricted self-bonding in recent years [^"5"], while this is a step in the right direction, it does not go far enough.

## Calculations
Of $10.2 billion outstanding bonds as of 2018, about 12%, or $1.2 billion, were self-bonds [^"7"].

## Implementation
Even with ending the practice of self-bonding, there will still be more progress to be made as the majority of environmental bonds do not fully cover the costs of reclamation[^"1"].
