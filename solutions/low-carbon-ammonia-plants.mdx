## Description
We promote the strategic use of low-carbon ammonia plants.

## Background
At 6 ¢/kWh, ammonia electrolysis will struggle to complete with production from coal or gas regardless of the plant's capacity factor. At 3 ¢/kWh, the plant might operate profitably at even less than 50% capacity.

#### Estimated costs of ammonia plants, with CO2 emissions valued at $50/ton, and cost of mitigated emissions. Estimates are based on a 500 metric ton per day plant, the threshhold between small and large plants given by ThyseenKrupp [^"19"].

## Calculations
We estimate the costs of carbon mitigation, using above cost estimates and below greenhouse gas estimates.

## Implementation
To be cost effective the ammonia plants would only run when electricity prices are cheap. This might mean a seasonal schedule.
