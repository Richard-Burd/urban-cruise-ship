At 6 ¢/kWh, ammonia electrolysis will struggle to complete with production from coal or gas regardless of the plant's capacity factor. At 3 ¢/kWh, the plant might operate profitably at even less than 50% capacity. We estimate the following costs of carbon mitigation, using above cost estimates and below greenhouse gas estimates.

#### Estimated costs of ammonia plants, with CO2 emissions valued at $50/ton, and cost of mitigated emissions. Estimates are based on a 500 metric ton per day plant, the threshhold between small and large plants given by ThyseenKrupp [^"19"].
