## Description
We recommend that an authoritative review of the environmental impacts of deep sea mining be conducted.

## Background
Deep sea mining will be necessary to fulfill the mineral demands of a high renewable economy, and it appears to have lower environmental impacts than terrestrial mining. However, more clarity is needed on risks to ocean floor ecosystems. An authoritative review should be conducted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA).

The ISA's strategic plan calls for developing regulations of deep sea mining (DSM) in international waters, protecting the marine environment, and encouraging and disseminating scientific research [^"9"]. A clear understanding of the ecological impacts of deep sea mining is necessary to achieve this plan. The ISA should commission a report that addresses the following questions.

- What is the full set of plausible impacts from DSM, and how likely are they?
- What ecosystems will be affected by DSM, and how sensitive are they?
- How much light and noise pollution and sediment disturbance is expected from DSM? How would these impacts compare with other oceanic activities, such as transcontinental shipping?
- What are the benefits of deep sea mining, particularly in displacing terrestrial mining and enabling a shift to low-carbon energy?
- What are the important knowledge gaps, and what research will fill them?
While there is a move today toward developing commercial deep sea mining, the ISA's proposed regulations [^"8"] are not based in a sufficiently clear understanding of the impacts.

## Calculations
This review would be modelled after the International Panel on Climate Change. We use the highest budgeted year from that report at $9.3 million[^"1"], to make a guess at the annual cost of such a report. 
A typical area of 75,000 km² with an estimated nodule resource of >200 million tonnes is expected to yield about 54 million tonnes of metals (Mn + Ni + Cu + Co), and the gross in-place value of the metals is estimated to be ∼$21‐42 billion (depending upon the annual rate of mining) in the 20-year life span of a mine site[^"2"].


## Implementation
The international Seabed Authority would conduct a review of the environmental impacts of deep sea mining and create a set of regulations and recommendations based on their findings. This would require interdisciplinary research and international cooperation to understand the economic, environmental, social, and legal implications of potential commercial deep-sea mining operations: a challenging endeavor due to the complexity of direct impacts and spillover effects[^"3"].
