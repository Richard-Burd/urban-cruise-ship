## Description

We recommend continued research and development into high-temperature solar heating technology.

## Background

Solar thermal technologies have proven effective in converting sunlight into heat for a range of applications. These technologies, such as compound parabolic collectors, linear fresnel collectors, and parabolic trough collectors (PTC), have been extensively studied for their efficiency and potential in industrial processes. However, they face limitations at very high temperatures. For instance, while PTCs can efficiently operate at temperatures up to 850 K (about 577°C), higher temperatures pose significant challenges frim radiation losses and the need for robust materials that can withstand intense thermal stresses [^"11"].

Recent experiments have revealed the potential of using quartz crystals to create solar furnaces capable of reaching temperatures up to 1050°C. These advancements are not only promising but also essential for high-emission sectors such as steel and cement production, which require process temperatures exceeding 1000°C. With further development, even higher temperatures could be achieved, making solar-driven high-temperature technologies a viable alternative to fossil fuels [^"12"].
