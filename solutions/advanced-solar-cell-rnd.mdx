We estimate that a research program into advanced solar cells has an expected benefit of about $125 billion and a cost of about $8 billion. We estimate the eventual cost to be 4 Â¢/kWh, with the same greenhouse gas and pollution costs as other forms of solar, and that it will take 10 years to commercialize new technology, with spending at the same $830 million per year as suggested by a [wave energy](/energy/energy_production/mhk) program. See our analysis of [research and development](/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) for more information.

The U.S. Department of Energy considers next generation solar cells to be necessary to achieve their goal of reducing solar PV capital costs from $1.30 per watt in 2020 to $0.50/W in 2050, to reduce O&M costs from $15.70/kW/year to $6.10/kW/year from 2020 to 2050, and to increase the capacity factor from 28% to 35% from 2020 to 2050 [^"47"].

Beyond conducting its own research, the Department of Energy should continue to support university research to advance solar cell technology, such as the 2022 Princeton University development of a perovskite solar cell with a 30 year lifespan [^"29"].
