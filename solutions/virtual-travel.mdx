## Description

We promote the practice of virtual travel, both for work and leisure, to reduce pollution and energy use.

## Background

Intercity and international travel for business is growing rapidly and will not go away, but there is a role to replace some long-distance trips with virtual travel, such as videoconferencing and telepresence.

Virtual Travel offers numerous conveniences, such as restoring a destination's historic original appearance, protecting cultural heritage, and making tourism accessible for tourists with constraints, including physical disabilities, financial difficulties and time constraints[^”1”]. Overall virtual tourists showed positive sentiment towards the virtual travel experience[^”1”].

Some benefits of virtual travel include savings in cost and time, increased safety, minimizing pollution, and access to information about the site that may not be available at the site[^”3”].

## Implementation

Virtual travel may benefit from the creation of travel communities. Virtual travel communities in general provide service benefits sought by community members along with pleasurable virtual travel experiences[^”2”].

Some concerns around virtual travel include creating a sense of place, the feeling of cultural presence, and having realistic and historically accurate environments and interactions[^”3”].
