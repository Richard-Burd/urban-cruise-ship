## Description

We examine solutions for reducing nightime office building light including municipal regulations to turn off office lights when offices are not in use, automated light systems and signage.

## Background

Globally, electric lighting generates at least 1900 million tons of CO2 with annual costs at least $360 billion USD [^"6"]. Over the course of the 20th century, the availability of affordable lighting led to persistant or permanant lighting even when not being used [^"2"]. Lights are often left on all day despite occupants spending half of the time away from workstations [^"5"]. Carbon emissions, energy costs and environmental concerns have encouraged various techniques to decrease unneccesary lighting, however there remains to be very little regulation for unneccesary nighttime office lighting [^"8"].

Clear signage requesting that the lights be turned off when not in use has been shown to be effective at changing behavior [^"1"].

Automation for lighting can also decrease unneccesary light usage [^"3"].
