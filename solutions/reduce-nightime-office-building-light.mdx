## Description
We recommend reducing nighttime office building light through a combination of municipal regulations to turn off office lights when offices are not in use, automated light systems, and signage.

## Background
Globally, electric lighting generates at least 1,900 million tons of CO2 with annual costs of at least $360 billion USD [^"6"]. Over the course of the 20th century, the availability of affordable lighting led to persistent or permanent lighting even when not being used [^"2"]. Lights are often left on all day despite occupants spending half of the time away from workstations [^"5"]. There currently is  very little regulation for unnecessary nighttime office lighting [^"8"].

Many office buildings remain illuminated overnight, even when unoccupied. This contributes to unnecessary energy consumption, increases greenhouse gas emissions (when electricity is sourced from fossil fuels), and exacerbates light pollution, which disrupts ecosystems and human health. Artificial nighttime lighting negatively affects migratory birds, insects, and human circadian rhythms[^"14"].

Implementing a combination of municipal regulations requiring offices to turn off lights when not in use, automated lighting systems that respond to occupancy sensors or time settings, and reminder signage can significantly reduce nighttime energy waste. Automation for lighting can decrease unnecessary light usage [^"3"], and clear signage requesting that the lights be turned off when not in use has been shown to be effective at changing behavior [^"1"]. Shanghai has enacted similar policies, demonstrating feasibility and effectiveness[^"15"].

## Calculations
Drafting and enforcing municipal regulations would require administrative costs for policy design, monitoring, and enforcement. These estimated costs would depend on city size and could vary greatly.
Occupancy sensors and smart lighting controls cost roughly $100 per sensor installed[^"16"].   
As an example, a [“Turn off the lights when not in use”]( https://www.homedepot.com/p/Lynch-Sign-7-in-x-10-in-Turn-Off-Lights-Sign-Printed-on-More-Durable-Longer-Lasting-Thicker-Styrene-Plastic-R-253/302886156?) sign can cost around $15 per sign.

A 30% total energy reduction across federal building was achieved due mostly to the implementation of energy-efficient lighting that included automatic lighting control systems[^"17"].
In the United States, nearly $7 billion is lost due to light pollution[^"18"]. This figure includes energy costs, health-related expenses, and other associated economic impacts[^"18"]. While reducing nighttime office lighting could mitigate a portion of these costs, precise valuation would require city-specific analysis.

## Implementation
Local governments and municipalities would implement and enforce the regulations. Energy agencies and  NGOs could advocate for and promote adoption of this solution. Building owners and companies would install automated lighting, signage, and comply with regulations.

Funding could be obtained through government energy efficiency grants such as the [Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program (EECBG)]( https://energycommunities.gov/funding-opportunity/bil-opportunity-energy-efficiency-and-conservation-block-grant-program-3/). Utility rebate programs such as those from [LightEdison]( https://www.lightedison.com/utility-rebates) could help to reduce the cost of retrofitting light control systems.
