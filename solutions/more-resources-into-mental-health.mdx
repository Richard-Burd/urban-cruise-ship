## Description

We reccomend increased investment into mental health resources.

## Background

While job creation is a high priority for governments, mental health often is not, despite its importance as a factor in life satisfaction.

In addition to being one of the most important factors in wellbeing, mental illness is common. Surveys have found that 21% of American adults suffer a mental illness, and 5.6 suffer a serious mental illness [^"14"]. In 2020, there were 45,979 suicides in the United States, nearly twice as many as the number of homicides [^"13"], and 1.2 million suicide attempts [^"1"].

## Implementation

This could be improved by, for instance, mandating that mental health services be covered by health insurance at parity with physical health, such as would be done by legislation introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2022 [^"15"]. While full cost-benefit results are unclear, earlier research found that mental health parity was less expensive than expected [^"9"],[^"11"].
