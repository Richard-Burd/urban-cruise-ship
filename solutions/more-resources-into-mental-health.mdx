## Description

We recommend mandating that mental health services be covered by health insurance at parity with physical health.

## Background
Mental health is a critical component of overall well-being, yet it is often neglected in the United States. One in five adults in the U.S. experiences mental illness each year, yet only about 43% receive treatment[^"2"]. Surveys have found that 21% of American adults suffer a mental illness, and 5.6 suffer a serious mental illness [^"14"]. In 2020, there were 45,979 suicides in the United States, nearly twice as many as the number of homicides [^"13"], and 1.2 million suicide attempts [^"1"]. The economic burden of untreated mental health issues is substantial, with estimates suggesting that serious mental illness contributes to $193 billion annually in lost earnings[^"3"]. Beyond economic impacts, untreated mental health issues contribute to reduced quality of life, increased rates of substance abuse, homelessness, and suicide.

Mandating that mental health services be covered by health insurance at parity with physical health could help close the treatment gap. Parity would mean that insurance plans must cover mental health services with the same limitations (e.g., copays, deductibles, visit limits) as physical health services. This has been shown to improve access to care, reduce stigma, and lead to earlier intervention, which can prevent the escalation of mental health conditions[^"4"]. Studies of existing parity laws, such as the [Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) of 2008]( https://www.cms.gov/marketplace/private-health-insurance/mental-health-parity-addiction-equity), demonstrate that increasing access to mental health services leads to better outcomes for individuals and society at large[^"5"],[^"6"].

## Calculations
Drafting legislation costs approximately $272,500 per state[^"7"], or $13.6 million for all 50 states.
In 2020 the U.S. Healthcare sector spent $714 million on federal lobbying activities[^"8"], assuming that there are at least 50 pieces of legislation[^"10"], then the cost of advocacy and lobbying would be $14.3 million or less.
We estimate a national public awareness campaign to cost $7.5 million annually[^"16"].
Regulatory oversight to monitor compliance, insurance adjustments to update policies, and auditing to ensure adherence would all add extra costs.

Benefits include reduced absenteeism and an increase in productivity, decreased healthcare costs due to early intervention, and lower rates of incarceration and homelessness[^"17"]. While currently there are no solid estimates for the benefits, the net benefits are likely to be substantial and significant[^"18"].

## Implementation

Legislation introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2022 [^"15"] was a good start and needs to be continued. While full cost-benefit results are unclear, earlier research found that mental health parity was less expensive than expected [^"9"],[^"11"]. Insurers may resist the change due to cost concerns and there may be an initial shortage of trained mental health professionals.
