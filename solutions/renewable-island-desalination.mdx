## Description
We propose building desalination plants powered by renewable energy to meet the fresh water demands of populations living on arid & semiarid islands with 500 square kilometers or less, and with populations of 250 people or more. More precisely, this proposal would target the semi-arid & subtropical islands of the Mediterranean Sea.

Due to highly favorable economic characteristics of renewable energy powered desalinization plants on Mediterranean islands to date, we propose the EU and World Bank supplement funding, where required, to obtain cost-benefit studies for all likely other candidates, so that all candidates can be prioritized relative to each other.  This would maximize both total value and build-put potential, by both maximizing financing confidence and allowing greater economies of scale for construction.

## Background
Many islands in the eastern Mediterranean Sea are experiencing extreme water shortages due to increasing demand on their aquifers as well as rainfall shortages brought on by climate change.  These islands import fresh water by ship from ports on mainland Europe.  That same water is transported to port from reservoirs by truck which is a carbon intensive process.  Some islands currently desalinate water powered by diesel/oil generatiors [^"9"] whereas a handful of islands have desalination plants powered by renewable energy [^"10"].

## Estimates
We look at 16 islands in the Mediterranean that are good candidates for receiving desalination plants powered by a combination of solar and/or wind (renewable) energy sources.  These locations are getting most or all of their water by shipping it in from the mainland at significant costs in terms of both money and environmental impact [^"1"], [^"2"].

</div>
#### Lindos is a region on the Island of Rhodes that faces water insecurity [^"3"]. Ithaki [^"6"] and Lastovo [^"7"] have slightly different climates from our baseline case studies but are nontheless good candidates for desalination plants. A study on Lemnos proposes a powerplant supplying both desalination as well as residential electricity [^"8"] with calculations similiar to our own.

## Calculations
Two studies proposing renewable-powered desalination plants were used to create <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/189VRc9oi8C9EtQIae3JT__E7OqGFq7Aq3M28uXNiB-4/edit?usp=sharing" onerror="this.href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tbhToWQaZLd2s0acm6iDBEGGJGz4SkSKC27-hpuZcEg/edit?usp=sharing'" target="_blank">a cost-benefit model</a>.  The first study looks at the Lipsi Island [^"1"] and the second one looks at Skyros island [^"2"].  While the former produces potable water for human consumption powered by wind turbines alone, the later uses wind & solar power to provide both potable (drinking) water as well as recycled waste water for agricultural use.  The costs in dollars and carbon are considered both in terms of the proposed project construction as well as the emission factors by transportation type [^"5"]  currently associated with relocating water from mainland reservoirs to the islands.  The Islands above were selected because they either lacked current desalination facilities and/or have an insecure water supply [^"3"], [^"4"].

## Implementation
We recommend that the European Union (EU), the World Bank [^"11"], and other bodies consider funding desalination projects for isolated & vulnerable communities that face water insecurity. This funding would have to be designed appropriately so as to not *'support everyone horizontally'* - i.e. luxry resorts and other non-essential water users [^"9"].  Construction crews would ship the project components to the Island and build the (renewable) power plants along with the reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants.  These RO plants are largely modular and fit into a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_container" target="_blank">intermodal shiping containers</a>, and thus, occupy a reduced footprint.  Operation and maintenance costs are included in the figures above and would most likely be provided by private sector contracting services.  Local expertise for construction methods should be consulted as appropriate so long as the conform to required design specifications.
