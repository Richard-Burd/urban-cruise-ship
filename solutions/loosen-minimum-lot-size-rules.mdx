## Description

We propose that minimum lot size regulations be eliminated.

We consider a scenario in which legislation across the United States results in the reduction of lot sizes for 10% of single family homes. Costs and benefits are assessed on a yearly basis, after the redevelopment has had time to occur. For those homes affected, current lot sizes are estimated to be 19% larger than they would be absent regulation [^"2"]. It is assumed that commercial, institutional, and transportation land use would shrink in the same proportions as residential land.


## Background

One of the most widespread zoning regulations is a minimum lot size, which requires that for every home, a minimum area is required. Such rules restrict the available amount of housing in a city and raise prices [^"8"], [^"17"], [^"36"]. It has been demonstrated that minimum lot size rules force larger developments than would otherwise be supplied by the market [^"6"].

## Calculations

Under our assumptions, 2,456 km² of land would be saved nationwide, resulting in a 1.6% increase in population density in single family zones.

We estimate that the average person living in a single family zone drives 28.8 miles per day [^"9"], that 60% of such residents drive, that the average car has an economy of 24.4 miles per gallon [^"7"], and that a gallon of gasoline emits 8,887 grams of CO₂ upon combustion [^"10"]. We estimate that the average driver would reduce driving by 0.8% to account for shorter distances between destinations. This would save 4.5 million tons of CO₂ emissions per year, valued at $224 million if CO₂ is priced at $50/ton.

By increasing the number of people able to live in metropolitan areas, minimum lot size rollbacks would have significant agglomeration benefits. Smaller lots would make room for housing to accommodate 3.9 million people and create an agglomeration benefit of $16.4 billion per year.

We expect that a minimum lot size reduction will cause substantial improvement in consumer welfare, as well as induce a redistribution from homeowners to renters and first-time buyers, but these effects are not quantified.

By reducing available road space, traffic congestion, if not mitigated by other means, would be a significant cost to a minimum lot size rollback. Traffic congestion cost the United States $87 billion in 2018 [^"4"]. If the increase in costs is proportional to the increase in traffic density resulting from less road space and less driving, then the congestion costs are $703 million per year.

Other potential costs, such as perceived loss of neighborhood preference, are not quantified [^"5"].


## Implementation

Many classes of zoning regulations, including minimum lot sizes, have been upheld by the Supreme Court, and there is little reason to expect a reversal of prior rulings. However, the disparate impact clause under the Fair Housing Act, whereby minimum lot sizes can be shown to disproportionately harm disadvantaged racial minority groups, is an avenue for legal challenge [^"3"]. Relaxing minimum lot size regulations will benefit racial minorities [^"30"].

Rollback of minimum lot size could be done legislatively by cities. It may be necessary for state governments to intervene, such as has been suggested with New York's minimum lot size rules [^"1"].
