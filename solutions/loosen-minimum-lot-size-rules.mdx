One of the most widespread zoning regulations is a minimum lot size, which requires that for every home, a minimum area is required. Such rules restrict the available amount of housing in a city and raise prices [^"8"], [^"17"], [^"36"].

By lowering population density below what it would otherwise be, minimum lot size regulations contribute to urban sprawl and resulting environmental costs, such as traffic congestion and land use impacts [^"3"]. In Connecticut, homes in towns with the largest lots are associated with 36.1% more transportation CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and 18.3% housing emissions than homes in the other towns [^"2"].

Many classes of zoning regulations, including minimum lot sizes, have been upheld by the Supreme Court, and there is little reason to expect a reversal of prior rulings. However, the disprate impact clause under the Fair Housing Act, whereby minimum lot sizes can be shown to disproportionately harm disadvantaged racial minority groups, is one possible avenue for a legal challenge [^"3"]. Relaxing minimum lot size regulations will benefit racial minorities [^"30"].
