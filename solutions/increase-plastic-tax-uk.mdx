## Description

We recommend the UK increase their current tax on plastic packaging in order to increase the recycled content found in plastic packaging.

## Background

In 2019, the production and incineration of plastic will add more than 850 million metric tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere—equal to the emissions from 189 five-hundred-megawatt coal power plants [^"12"]. Plastic production is growing and is expected to quadruple by 2050 [^"3"], raising plastic production emissions to over a gigaton annually [^"13"]. Plastics alone use 6% of the global oil production, and they require approximately 185 liters of water per kilogram [^"3"] With an annual output of 322 million metric tons of plastic, this is nearly 60 billion liters of water used per year, assuming the vast majority is composed of virgin materials [^"3"]. With only 9% of plastic waste being recycled on a global level, we assume the amount of newly produced plastic using recycled materials to be low [^"15"].

Plastic taxes have been shown to reduce plastic consumption effectively in more developed countries around the world [^"3"]. A plastic tax has been investigated as a way to decrease plastic pollution in Florida, and provide for a disaster relief fund [^"11"].

The EU imposes a plastic tax on all its member countries of 80 cents per kilogram [^"6"]. Spain has introduced a tax on single use plastics [^"5"].

Increasing recycled content to 50% in plastic production will require new facilities for reprocessing, and there will also be a need for more plastic sorting facilities To support the increased demand for recycled plastics resulting from the tax changes, an estimated £1.1 billion investment is necessary to expand the UK’s recycling facilities. This would involve upgrading existing facilities and constructing new ones that are capable of processing a higher volume of recyclable materials with greater efficiency [^"12"]. These investments will be funded by an phased increase of the current plastic tax of £217.85 to £500 per ton [^"12"]. The first year has already generated £276 million in revenue [^"16"].

## Calculations

Benefits are quantified in terms of avoided social cost of carbon, using a rate of US$ 99.34 per ton. It should be noted that many unquantified benefits are not represented in this benefit-cost assessment, such as increased jobs, and other positive environmental effects that could result from decreased pollution [^"12"].

#### Costs are divided over a ten-year span. [^"12"].

We calculate costs in terms of facility investment [^"12"].

Further research is needed to assess additional social, environmental and economic benefits, as well as additional costs, and the impact on industry and consumers.

## Implementation

The tax revenue generated by the tax exceeded expectations in the UK [^"1"]. It will be important to invest in public awareness campaigns to educate the public about the benefits of recycling and the importance of reducing plastic waste. Studies in germany have indicated a willingness for consumers to pay for a plastic tax if the money is used to help mitigate environmental damages [^"7"].
