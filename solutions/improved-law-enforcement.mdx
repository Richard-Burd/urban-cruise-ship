## Description

We recommend improvements to law enforcement by conducting more inclusive cost benefit analysis on police departments.

## Background

From 1977 to 2019, police budgets increased from US$44 billion to US$123 billion[^"8"]. The perspective of a law enforcement organization is insufficient for conducting benefit-cost analysis[^"6"]. Often, policing has omitted the cost analysis in the evaluation of the detrimental effect law enforcement itself can have on a community. Law enforcement should be analyzed and criticised from an inclusive perspective of all members of society[^"7"].

These elements of law enforcement are often overlooked:

- Incarceration itself can cause an individual to commit more crimes after release[^"6"]
- Parental incarceration negatively impacts children health and school attendance, but also increases the chances of criminality.
- Wrongful convictions, with 4.1% of death sentences being a result of wrongful convictions.

By including the benefits of increased safety and the direct and indirect costs to all members of society, better policy options can be found[^"6"]. 

The New York Law Review finds that federal programs can encourage harmful policing, and shows how law enforcement analysis often fails to weigh the costs of policing in the form of arrests, uses of force, privacy invasions, and killings against the societal benefits[^"7"].



## Implementation


The city of Camden, New Jersey, rebuilt its police force using a community-focused approach that included a psychological evaluation and other screening for all officers[^"8"].
