## Description	

We recommend the promotion of low impact fiber crops for clothing production and examine the environmental benefits and potential drawbacks of hemp, jute, and linen.

## Background

Hemp cultivation requires significantly less water than cotton and can grow in a variety of climates without the need for extensive pesticide or fertilizer use. It is also possesses higher strength and durability compared to cotton. Compared to cotton, hemp requires fewer pesticides, fertilizers, and water. Hemp's fast growth rate enables more frequent harvests, and a high yield per acre improves soil health. Its deep root system likewise protect against soil erosion [^"1"].

Jute is a long, soft, shiny vegetable fiber that can be spun into coarse, strong threads. It's derived from plants in the genus Corchorus, which is primarily grown in warm, humid regions including Bangladesh, India, and China. Jute is commonly used to make burlap, hessian cloth, and sackcloth. Jute is considered sustainable due to its efficient photosynthesis, ability to grow without the need for large amounts of pesticides or fertilizers, and its biodegradability. It acts as a carbon dioxide sink and has a high carbon dioxide assimilation rate. Jute cultivation supports biodiversity and enriches the fertility of the soil for future crops. The water requirement for jute is also relatively low, especially compared to cotton [^"2"].

Linen is a textile made from the fibers of the flax plant (Linum usitatissimum). It is one of the oldest textiles in the world, with a history dating back thousands of years. Linen is known for its strong, durable nature and is commonly used in clothing, bed linens, and other household textiles. One acre of flax can sequester about 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide annually. Flax cultivation does not generally need irrigation, as rainwater suffices, making it less water-intensive compared to cotton. The flax crop can be harvested within about 100 days without the need for significant pesticide or fertilizer usage. Linen is also biodegradable and recyclable, contributing to a lower environmental impact. The production process of linen is less water-intensive, and the entirety of the flax plant can be used, leading to minimal waste [^"3"].

## Implementation

These alternative fibers come with challenges including higher processing complexities, less developed supply chains, and increased energy requirements for processing. Limited infrastructure can increase the environmental impact due to transportation needs. This could be lessened by a more widespread adoption 
The initial cost of hemp products can be higher than cotton due to processing complexities and less developed supply chains [^"1"] [^"2"] [^"3"].
