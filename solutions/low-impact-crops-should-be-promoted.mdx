## Description	

We recommend the promotion of low impact fiber crops to replace the impacts of cotton production and examine the environmental benefits and potential drawbacks of hemp, jute, and linen.

## Background
Cotton is the most widely used natural fiber globally, occupying approximately 2.3% of the world’s arable land but consuming 10.51% of all insecticides, 4% of all pesticides, and 3.1% of all herbicide use  annually[^"4"]. It also requires around 10,000 liters per kilogram of cotton produced. Cotton production can also cause soil degradation and loss of biodiversity due to monocropping and the heavy chemical inputs.

Hemp cultivation requires significantly less water than cotton and can grow in a variety of climates without the need for extensive pesticide or fertilizer use. It also possesses higher strength and durability compared to cotton.  Hemp is considered highly sustainable due to its low need for pesticides and fertilizers, its minimal water requirements compared to conventional crops like cotton, and its fast growth rate which enables more frequent harvests. Hemp also has a high yield per acre and can improve soil health. Its deep root system can likewise protect against soil erosion [^"1"].

Jute is a long, soft, shiny vegetable fiber that can be spun into coarse, strong threads. It's derived from plants in the genus Corchorus, which is primarily grown in warm, humid regions including Bangladesh, India, and China. Jute is commonly used to make burlap, hessian cloth, and sackcloth. Jute is considered sustainable due to its efficient photosynthesis, ability to grow without the need for large amounts of pesticides or fertilizers, and its biodegradability. It acts as a carbon dioxide sink and has a high carbon dioxide assimilation rate. Jute cultivation supports biodiversity and enriches the fertility of the soil for future crops. The water requirement for jute is also relatively low, especially compared to cotton [^"2"].

Linen is a textile made from the fibers of the flax plant (Linum usitatissimum). It is one of the oldest textiles in the world, with a history dating back thousands of years. Linen is known for its strong, durable nature and is commonly used in clothing, bed linens, and other household textiles. One acre of flax can sequester about 1.5 tons of CO2 annually. Flax cultivation does not generally need irrigation, as rainwater suffices, making it less water-intensive compared to cotton. The flax crop can be harvested within about 100 days without the need for significant pesticide or fertilizer usage. Linen is also biodegradable and recyclable, contributing to a lower environmental impact. The production process of linen is less water-intensive, and the entirety of the flax plant can be used, leading to minimal waste [^"3"].

## Calculations
In the following exploratory example we are using hemp as a replacement for cotton as we have the most recent and comprehensive data when compared to other alternative crops. We examine replacing one third of all cotton fiber production with hemp production.

About 32 million hectares of cotton are farmed annually for fiber production[^"6"],[^"7"]. We will use 10.56 million hectares as a one third replacement goal for these calculations.

While not exactly the same as conversion costs, the following estimated setup costs for hemp production can give us an idea of what conversion costs might be. Hemp fiber setup and operation costs, including seed, fertilizer, labor, fuel, and equipment are estimated at $1,939 per hectare[^"8"],[^"9"]. Actual conversion costs are likely to be lower as many of the costs are already in place for current cotton production. Currently hemp production costs more in energy to produce, using approximately 23,816 MJ per metric ton compared to 18,651 MJ per ton of cotton produced[^"12"] however it is generally thought that an increase in hemp production will lead to greater efficiencies that will equalize energy consumption.

Hemp fiber yields were found to be about 3.45 times greater per hectare per year than cotton[^"12"], meaning that by replacing one third of cotton fiber production, hemp could potentially produce enough to replace the other two thirds of cotton production as well.

Hemp production requires about 37% less water than cotton[^"10"],[^"11"]. With cotton using roughly 8,500 cubic meters of water per hectare[^"7"],[^"10"],[^"11"], that would mean a savings of 3,145 cubic meters per hectare annually. Water savings were found to be about $800 per hectare annually[^"12"].

In general hemp production uses no pesticides as the high seeding rate blocks out weeds and its quick growth allows for harvest before pests do much damage[^"12"]. While there is potential for pesticide need in the future if hemp is grown in monoculture situations, a crop rotation every four years was shown to mitigate even these low risks[^"12"]. This would equal a savings of about $236.6 per hectare annually[^"12"]. That savings does not include the reduction of health issues and environmental impacts caused by the pesticide and herbicide use of cotton production.

Cotton grown with no-till conservation agriculture is estimated to sequester .48 Mg Carbon per hectare per year[^"13"]. Hemp has been shown to sequester about 11 tones of Carbon per hectare per year, and possibly double that if there are two harvests[^"14"]. With a [Social Cost of Carbon](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) estimated at $141.4 per ton that would equal about $1,555 per hectare per year.

## Implementation

These alternative fibers come with challenges including higher processing complexities, less developed supply chains, and increased energy requirements for processing. Limited infrastructure can increase the environmental impact due to transportation needs. This could be lessened by a more widespread adoption and efficiency improvement.

The initial cost of hemp products can be higher than cotton due to processing complexities and less developed supply chains [^"1"] [^"2"] [^"3"]. Subsidies could help conversion of processing equipment and supply chains. In some areas there will need to be legal reform to allow hemp production.
