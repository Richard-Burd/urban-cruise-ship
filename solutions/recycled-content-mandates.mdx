import SolutionDropdown from '/components/SolutionDropdown.js'

export const problem = "Material Loss";
export const solution = "Recycled Content Mandates";

## Description
We propose that states establish recycled content mandates to the extent that they are financially feasible.

## Background

## Calculations

## Implementation
Manufacturers  typically are against requirements on recycled content as requirements may not be possible to control through internal procedures which can have supply chain implications, or compliance is affected by consumer behavior[^”1”].
