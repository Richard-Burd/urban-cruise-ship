## Description
We propose that states establish recycled content procurement mandates for plastics to the extent that they are financially feasible.

## Background

In progress

## Calculations

In progress

## Implementation
Manufacturers  typically are against requirements on recycled content as requirements may not be possible to control through internal procedures which can have supply chain implications, or compliance is affected by consumer behavior[^"1"].

Model legislation calls for, over time, the mandated postconsumer plastic content to be between 20% and 40% for film bags, 15-25% for single-use containers, and 25-75% for durable containers, as well as third party verification.
