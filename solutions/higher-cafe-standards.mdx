## Description

We recommend that the United States government increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, as proposed by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

## Background

Congress established the first CAFE standards in 1975, in response to the first oil crisis, and standards were increased under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 [^"10"]. Lasting improvements to fuel economy and fuel-saving technological innovation have been directly attributed to the standards [^"15"]. Retrospective studies have found substantial net present benefits to the CAFE program [^"16"].

NHTSA has proposed increasing efficiency requirements by 2% annually for passenger cars and 4% annually for light trucks for each model year from 2027 through 2032, as well as a 10% annual increase in standards for heavy-duty trucks and vans from 2030 to 2035 [^"1"].

#### Per-vehicle costs are based on increased manufacturing costs to comply with
higher CAFE standards, while benefits are based on fuel savings. All figures are
calculated at a 3% discount rate, and environmental benefits are not included. A
positive net present value is expected with a 7% discount rate as well. Source: NHSTA
[^"1"].

## Calculations

We estimate costs and benefits for passenger vehicles by applying the per-vehicle figures above to 16 million vehicles sold annually; this is the number that were sold from July 2023 to June 2024 [^"6"]. The report estimates that 900 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> will be saved over 20 years as a result of the rule, which we apply with a valuation of $141 per ton. The report further estimates $2.1 billion in costs and $4.3 billion in benefits for the truck and van portion of the rule at a 3% discount rate.

Historically, stricter CAFE standards have driven technological advancements in the automotive industry [^"4"], though this possible effect is not modeled here.

Consumer Reports argues that the rule underestimates net present benefits by failing to fully account for the use of hybrid cars and supports a more stringent ultimate standard of 65-68 miles per gallon [^"9"].

Given positive net present benefits found for higher CAFE standards, it is unclear why consumers do not voluntary choose more efficient vehicles absent regulation. There is evidence that consumers are rationally responsive to gasoline prices in choosing the efficiency for new car purchases [^"12"]. Unquantified in the NHTSA study is consumer preferences for vehicle speed, power, and size [^"11"], and these considerations might explain purchase behavior.

## Implementation

Wang assesses that meeting the higher standards will entail downsizing in passenger cars and light trucks [^"4"]. Two reforms to the CAFE program are to end the differential treatment of passenger cars and light trucks, further discussed below, and to end the differential treatment of domestic and foreign automakers [^"13"].

A rebound effect from higher CAFE efficiency has been found. Estimates of the magnitude of this effect range from zero to 40%, with an average of 8.1% for those studies based on odometer readings [^"17"]. Given additional externalities to driving, such as traffic congestion, safety, and air pollution, CAFE standards are not suitable as a full substitute for fuel taxes or some other kind of pricing [^"14"].
