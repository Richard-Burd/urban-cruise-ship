## Description
We recommend the United States government proceed with the implementation of increased Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, as proposed by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

## Background
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has proposed increasing efficiency requirements incrementally from the 2027 through 2032 model years. This plan involves a 2% annual increase for passenger cars and a 4% annual increase for light trucks. Additionally, there is a proposal for a 10% annual increase for heavy-duty trucks and vans from 2030 to 2035. [^"1"]

Additional benefits include:

- Emission Reductions: Improved fuel efficiency directly correlates with decreased CO2 emissions from vehicles, contributing to environmental sustainability.  [^"1"]

- Innovation Stimulation: Historically, stricter CAFE standards have driven technological advancements in the automotive industry. [^"4"]

## Calculations
Using an average of 13.5 million new vehicles sold annually[^"6"], we calculate an annual cost of 12.58 billion. Total fuel savings is calculated to 14.08 billion. The average driver in the U.S. drove 13,596 miles in 2022[^"7"]. Also in 2022, new vehicles averaged 337g per mile of CO2 emissions[^"8"]. With the 3% reduction from the CAFÉ standards that would be 1.86 million tons of CO2 reduced annually. With a social cost valued at $141.4 per ton that adds $263 million in annual benefits.

## Implementation

A Cornell University study predicted that automobile companies would be able to meet the high 2025 fuel economy target by making medium downsizing in cars and minor downsizing in light-duty trucks. [^"4"]
