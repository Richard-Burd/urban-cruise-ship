## Description

We recommend that the U. S. Department of Energy invest $8.3 billion over 10 years to support wave energy research and development.

## Calculations

Previsic [^"27"] estimates that a full wave energy R&D program would require $2.5 billion on research, $300 million for early commercialization efforts, and $5.5 billion for subsidies as the industry develops, for a total of $8.3 billion.

Benefits are based on a model such that, after a 10 year research period, wave energy grows by 2% of its ultimate market potential per year. Based on a learning curve analysis, we estimate that wave energy could fall from its present high price to 6 ¢/kWh. As wave energy is suitable on the coast and where there is good wave resource, we estimate that 20% of the world electricity market would be suitable for wave energy. Financial and environmental benefits are calculated by assuming that wave energy displaces other sources of electricity that are more expensive.

By focusing early commercialization on islands and other areas with expensive electricity, the needed subsidy might be reduced. See our analysis of [research and development](/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) for more information.

## Implementation

Congress recently increased the DOE's budget for ocean energy research to $109 million, a welcome move but still only about 13% of the value we recommend if continued for 10 years [^"16"]. A full research program will support all aspects of companies' efforts to commercialize wave technology, particularly development of test sites that can simulate the harsh ocean environment [^"34"].
