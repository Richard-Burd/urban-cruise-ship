## Description

We recommend international organizations and world governments increase spending on tuberculosis diagnosis, care, and prevention. We also reccomend a vaccine be developed for tuberculosis.

## Background

Tuberculosis(TB) the leading cause of death worldwide, creating 10 million new infections annually[^"2"]. Tuberculosis (TB) is a global public health problem caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can also affect other parts of the body (extrapulmonary TB). The disease is spread through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks[^"6"].

25% of the world's population is latently infected with the TB bacteria[^"3"].  45% of people who are contract TB, and are left untreated die[^"1"]. Rapid diagnosis and targeted treatment are crucial to averting mortaility and for prevention of disease transmission[^"3"]. Treatment is often frustrated by the stigma surrounding the diagnosis[^"5"]. Tuberculosis has been historically linked to marginalized and low-income groups[^"5"]. Research and development of a vaccine for tuberculosis is predicted to save millions of lives and provide a pathway to elimination of the disease[^"1"].

The costs include[^"1"]:

- Diagnosis: The cost of finding out if someone has TB through tests and examinations.
- Treatment: The expense of medicines and medical care needed to cure TB.
- Prevention: Costs related to stopping TB from spreading, such as vaccinations or treatments for people at high risk.
- Health Systems: Expenses for the overall healthcare system to support TB care, including hospitals and clinics.
- Enablers: Costs for activities that help the TB fight, like patient support, advocacy, and education.
- Program Costs: The overhead costs of running TB control programs, including planning, management, and administration.
- Vaccination: The specific costs of buying and giving vaccines to prevent TB.

- Benefits are derived soley from averted mortality. Benefits due to averted cases is not tabulated[^"1"].

## Implementation

Eliminating TB will require a concerted effort from the international community. The UN Sustainable Development Goals’ target to end the epidemic by 2030, however more work is needed[^"5"]. As of 2022, increased investment is needed in order to meet the development goals, and, according to the WHO, another US$1 Billion are needed to accelerate the research and development.

US$ 13 billion are needed annually for TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care to achieve global targets agreed on at the UN high level-TB meeting. 
As in the past decade, most of the spending on TB services in 2022 (80%) was from domestic sources. In low- and middle-income countries, international donor funding remains crucial. The main source is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global Fund). The United States Government is the largest contributor of funding to the Global Fund and also the largest bilateral donor. For research and development, according to the Treatment Action Group, only US$ 1 billion were available in 2022 of the US$ 2 billion required per year to accelerate the development of new tools. At least an extra US$ 1 billion per year is needed to accelerate the development of new tools[^"7"].
