As discussed above, ethanol carries significant land use and water costs, and it reduces greenhouse gases only marginally over conventional fuels. For this reason, we propose repealing ethanol mandates and subsidies.

The main U. S. federal mandate is the Renewable Fuel Standard. Although it calls for 36 billion gallons of ethanol to be blended into gasoline in 2022, the actual mandate is 15 billion gallons due to limited supply [^"5"].

In addition to the mandate, there are several subsidies for ethanol production.

#### Source: [^"33"]. Figures for crop insurance and commodity subsidies are allocated to corn ethanol based on that ethanol comprises 40% of the U. S. corn crop. Other subsidies, whose monetary value is not assessed, include the Market Access Program and Master Limited Partnerships.

High ethanol blending also imposes costs in the form of wear and tear on engines [^"19"].

As of 2014, it was estimated that without mandates or subsidies, corn ethanol demand would have been about 30% of actual demand [^"7"].

There are legislative efforts to repeal the mandate [^"10"].
