## Description
We propose repealing corn ethanol mandates and subsidies in the United States.

## Background
Corn ethanol mandates and subsidies were introduced in the United States largely under the [Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)]( https://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-program/overview-renewable-fuel-standard-program) program, created by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and expanded by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The goal was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease reliance on imported oil, and support rural economies by boosting domestic biofuel production.
While the RFS calls for 36 billion gallons of ethanol to be blended into gasoline in 2022, the actual mandate is 15 billion gallons due to limited supply [^"1"], an amount that has generally been stable since 2015. Subsidies have included blender tax credits, crop insurance subsidies, and production incentives, amounting to $4.1 billion per year in federal support[^"4"]. As of 2014, it was estimated that without mandates or subsidies, corn ethanol demand would have been about 30% of actual demand [^"3"].

While ethanol reduces greenhouse gases only marginally over conventional fuels, it carries significant costs. Environmental concerns include soil degradation, water overuse, water pollution from fertilizer runoff, and biodiversity loss from monocropping.

High ethanol blending also imposes costs in the form of wear and tear on engines [^"2"].
The resources put in to meeting corn ethanol mandates could be redirected towards more sustainable energy solutions and could also help stabilize the food price of corn.

## Calculations
In addition to the mandate, there are several subsidies for ethanol production. The money saved from removing these subsidies is counted as a benefit.

#### Source: [^"4"]. Figures for crop insurance and commodity subsidies are allocated to corn ethanol based on that ethanol comprises 40% of the U. S. corn crop. Other subsidies, whose monetary value is not assessed, include the Market Access Program and Master Limited Partnerships.

A reduction of indirect costs, including higher food prices and environmental damage, could lead to significant benefits[^"6"].

Roughly 40% (or 13 million hectares) of U.S. corn production is used for ethanol[^"7"]. Assuming that a repeal of corn ethanol mandates and subsidies would result in a 50% reduction of corn ethanol demand, that would mean 6.5 million hectares of land that could be repurposed. These lands could be used to produce other food crops which would improve food diversity and possibly help lower global food prices. If the goal is to maximize carbon emission reduction, the land could be converted to conservation or agroforestry purposes. This has the potential of .7 metric tons of CO₂/hectare/year of Carbon sequestration[^"8"].

## Implementation
There are legislative efforts to repeal the mandate [^"5"]. An effort should be made to ensure that more policy makers are aware of this information. While congress must approve legislative changes, the [U.S. EPA]( https://www.epa.gov/) would oversee any changes to RFS while the [USDA]( https://www.usda.gov/) would handle any removal of subsidies. A gradual phase-out over a 5-10 year period would allow farmers to transition their land and keep fuel markets more stable. Public awareness campaigns could be helpful to gain the support of citizens and reduce political resistance to these changes.
