## Description
We propose repealing ethanol mandates and subsidies.

## Background
While ethanol reduces greenhouse gases only marginally over conventional fuels, it carries significant land and water use costs. 
The main U.S. federal mandate is the Renewable Fuel Standard. Although it calls for 36 billion gallons of ethanol to be blended into gasoline in 2022, the actual mandate is 15 billion gallons due to limited supply [^"1"].
High ethanol blending also imposes costs in the form of wear and tear on engines [^"2"].
As of 2014, it was estimated that without mandates or subsidies, corn ethanol demand would have been about 30% of actual demand [^"3"].

## Calculations
In addition to the mandate, there are several subsidies for ethanol production. The money saved from removing these subsidies is counted as a benefit.

#### Source: [^"4"]. Figures for crop insurance and commodity subsidies are allocated to corn ethanol based on that ethanol comprises 40% of the U. S. corn crop. Other subsidies, whose monetary value is not assessed, include the Market Access Program and Master Limited Partnerships.

## Implementation
There are legislative efforts to repeal the mandate [^"5"]. An effort should be made to ensure that more policy makers are aware of this information.
