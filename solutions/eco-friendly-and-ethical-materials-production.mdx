## Description
We promote replacing animal and plastic based materials with bio-based materials such as using mushrooms to make leather alternatives. As an example we will explore replacing all bovine sourced leather with mushroom sourced leather creation.

## Background
Traditional leather has high environmental impacts, animal welfare issues, and high toxicity of tanning chemicals[^”1”]. Plastic based vegan alternatives also have significant environmental impacts. Bio-based alternatives with a focus on life cycle impact reduction, such as pineapple leaf fiber and mycelium, greatly reduce the environmental impacts[^”1”].

## Calculations
Bovine based leather has a carbon footprint of 32.97kg of CO₂e per m²[^”2”]. Reishi™ produces 3.87kg of CO₂e per m² produced[^”2”]. 2.14 billion m² of leather is produced every year globally[^”3”]. 65% of that is bovine sourced[^”3”], equaling 1.39 billion m². This would equal a reduction of 40.45 million tons of CO₂e, at $50 per ton equaling $2.02 billion.

## Implementation
Policies to support this switch, such as subsidies or taxes on animal and plastic based products, could help to boost production of these bio-based alternative products.
