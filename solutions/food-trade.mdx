## Description
As the food system's emissions are much greater in the growing phase than in the transportation phase, we propose that countries retain freedom of food trade. Restrictions on food trade will generally increase growing emissions by more than they will decrease transportation emissions.

## Background
About 23% of the food produced for human consumption is traded internationally[^”1”]. Many regions of the world are in conditions of food shortage due to a local imbalance between production and demand[^”1”].

The energy spent in car use for eating out has been estimated at 20 MJ per outside meal[^”2”]. It is estimated that the environmental impact of car based shopping are greater  than those of transport within the distribution system itself[^”2”].


## Calculations
Each year, 200 billion metric tons of food are transported globally – 60% by sea, 35% by land, and 5% by air[^”2”].


## Implementation
There will need to be an agreement between nations to keep food trade unrestricted. This agreement will be monitored by the United Nations.
