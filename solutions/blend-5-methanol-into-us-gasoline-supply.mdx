## Description
We recommend that Congress institute a national methanol blending program into gasoline, similar to the current ethanol blending program.

## Cost Calculations
Costs and benefits assume a methanol blending that replaces 5% of gasoline in the United States, and no other fuels, with methanol. Financial costs of adding methanol are based on the median value ($280/ton) of methanol from natural gas without carbon capture and sequestration.

## Benefit Calculations 
Financial benefits of displacing gasoline are based on the average wholesale gasoline price in 2019 [^"26"]. Emissions of gasoline and methanol are as detailed above. Much greater emissions reductions are possible if methanol is produced from low-carbon processes.

These figures do not account for pollution costs beyond greenhouse gases. Methanol blending results in a decrease in carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions, and an increase in NOx emissions [^"10"]. If made from local energy sources, methanol blending would also bring an unquantified benefit in energy security.

## Implementation 
Federal legislation, similar to the current mandate to blend ethanol into the gasoline supply [^"18"], is one way the goal could be accomplished.

Experience in Shaanxi Province, China, where M15 has become common, shows that recently manufactured cars should be able to use M15 without modification, though some old storage tanks and other infrastructure may need to be upgraded to handle the slightly more corrosive mix [^"13"].

Methanol is highly toxic to humans and can cause blindness and death, though is not more toxic than gasoline. When spilled, methanol biodegrades faster than gasoline or diesel and generally causes less environmental damage [^"4"].
