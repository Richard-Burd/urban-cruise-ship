## Description
We propose streamlining the stack of building and fire codes and permits and inspection requirements for rooftop solar in the U.S. This will reduce the cost and construction time of new rooftop solar projects.

## Background
While the cost of solar technology continues to fall, the burden of permitting remains a barrier to progesss.
Currently rooftop solar installations are treated more like a full construction process (building a new foundation) rather than like adding a new appliance (adding a new HVAC system) when it comes to permits and inspections.
‘Soft costs’, like permits and inspections can cost up to half of total installation costs, averaging $3,000 per installation[^”1”].
Because current codes vary widely as well as their interpretations and enforcement, it can take up to two months just to get permits approved[^”1”]. The average time after completion to approved inspection to begin using the system is 45 days[^”1”]. This means that from time of purchase it can easily be four months before the system is operational.

## Implementation
While national standards and systems can be set in place, local policy will still need to be approved and carried out. The permitting process can be done online with standardized questions and give instant permit approval[^”1”]. Inspections can be done virtually which would allow inspectors to complete more inspections per day[^”1”].
