import SolutionDropdown from '/components/SolutionDropdown.js'

export const problem = "Food Waste";
export const solution = "Restrict Restaurant Meal Size";

We propose regulations to restrict the meal portion size as restaurants, both to improve health and reduce food waste.

export default ({ children }) => 
  <SolutionDropdown 
    problem={problem} 
    solution={solution}
  >
    {children}
  </SolutionDropdown>
