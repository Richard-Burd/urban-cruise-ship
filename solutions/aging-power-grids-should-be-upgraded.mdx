## Background
Several aspects of power grids can be upgraded to reduce transmission losses. The possibilities include reconductoring (installing new conductor wires), reactive power compensation, expanding use of high voltage direct current (HVDC), and voltage optimization, among other tools [^"1"].

While it is generally not cost-effective to replace existing equipment prematurely, it is often cost-effective to replace equipment at the end of its life with equipment designed to higher efficiency standards [^"1"].

The cost of electricity savings, per kilowatt-hour of saved electricity, in Australia has been estimated as follows.

The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gave the U.S. power grid a C- rating with over 70% being at least 25 years old[^”3”]. Extensive infrastructure and transmission upgrades and expansion will be needed to maintain the grid system and prepare for the influx of renewable energy production and transmission.

The benefits of grid upgrades and expansion include: adding more renewable energy to grid systems, reduction of power bottlenecks, improves reliability and resiliency, and creates jobs and boosts economy[^”4”].

## Calculations
The ASCE estimates a funding gap of $200 billion over the next 5 years[^”3”], which translates into $40 billion annually.

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (that manages the power grid of 17 states in the middle of the U.S.) found that benefits of upgrading and expansion of power grids are on average 2.8 times greater than the costs[^”5”]. This would gain a benefit of $112 billion annually if the spending gap above was met.

## Implementation
Planning, permitting, and carrying out upgrades and expansions can take up to 15 years per project[^”6”]. One major problem currently is sourcing the materials for new transformers, which can be backlogged for up to four years and keep increasing in price due to demand.
