## Description

We reccomend the United States upgrade the aging power grid with higher efficiency systems.

## Background

Several aspects of power grids can be upgraded to reduce transmission losses. The possibilities include reconductoring (installing new conductor wires), reactive power compensation, expanding use of high voltage direct current (HVDC), and voltage optimization, among other tools [^"8"].

While it is generally not cost-effective to replace existing equipment prematurely, it is often cost-effective to replace equipment at the end of its life with equipment designed to higher efficiency standards [^"8"].
