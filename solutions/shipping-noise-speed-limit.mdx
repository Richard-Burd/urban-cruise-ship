## Description
We recommend world governments form an international agreement implementing “Blue Speeds”, a marine vessel speed reduction to 75% of maximum design speed, in order to reduce underwater noise levels. [^"2"]


## Background

Marine species rely upon sound for finding mates [^"4"], avoiding predators [^"5"], finding offspring [^"4"], navigation [^"5"], and obtaining food [^"5"]

Underwater noise pollution is drowning out natural ocean sounds for marine life. [^"1"]
- Sound travels 4 times faster in water than in air [^"5"]
- Many sources of underwater noise pollution exist including military sonar, seismic airguns, and explosives. [^"11"] 
- Commercial shipping is the most pervasive source of ocean noise. [^"1"]
- An average cargo vessel traveling at 16 knots emits over 190 dB of sound [^"6"], more than the amount needed to cause eardrum rupture in humans (150dB) [^"7"]
- There are few areas of the ocean that are not impacted by shipping noise [^"5"]
- Shipping noise is doubling every decade [^"5"]

Ship noise has been shown to increase stress in North Atlantic right whales [^"8"], reduce Orca foraging [^"9"], negatively impact seagrass health and cause many other deleterious effects. [^"5"] Blue whales’ communication range, which could once span entire ocean basins, has shrunk by 90%. [^"1"] Ship noise produces sound in a low frequency which overlaps with the frequency for communication in baleen whales, fish, seals, sea lions, and dolphins. [^"11"]
 
Ship designs can be made quieter. [^"1"]
- 85% of underwater noise is due to propeller design [^"1"]
- Certain vessels such as warships and research vessels are typically designed to operate quietly at lower speeds (below 15 knots) [^"3"]
- Merchant ships are not designed for quiet operation, and propeller noise increases with speed on a logarithmic scale [^"3"]
- New ships could be fitted with reduced noise propellers for 1-5% of the total cost of the vessel, however, retrofitting a quiet propeller onto existing vessels will result in greater costs. [^"12"] 
- Worldwide enforcement for propeller design would be very challenging, and retrofitting all existing vessels would be far more difficult. [^"1"]

Reduced speeds decreases the chances of ship-strikes with whales [^"2"]

#### *Operations & Maintenance  †Inventory costs increase due to increase voyage time  ‡Increased CO₂ emissions from steel production needed for new ships divided over a 30-year period [^"2"] [^"17"]

## Implementation

Speed limits would be based on the type of ship. [^"2"] Adjustments would need to be made to accommodate outliers and ensure ship safety [^"2"]

There is industrial support for ship speed limits. [^"14"] Ships have voluntarily slowed thier speeds in order to protect whale populations. [^"18"] Efforts should be made to assist shipping companies due to the increased inventory costs associated with a slow-down [^"16"], as increases in these costs can outweigh fuel savings. [^"16"] Slower speeds also mean that vessels are more likely to arrive on time. [^"16"]

Additional Solutions
- Working on improving communication between ships can help prevent waiting times for ships attempting to dock [^"15"]
- Incentivizing quiet ships: Ports of Vancouver and Prince Rupert gave discounted harbor fees to ships that met low-noise criteria [^"18"]
