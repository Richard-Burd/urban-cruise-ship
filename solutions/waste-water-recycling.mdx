## Description

We propose to build infrastructure to treat and reuse 178 billion m³ of wastewater.

## Background

Only 11% of the estimated total of domestic and industrial wastewater produced is currently being reused[^”1”].
Untreated wastewater is one of the key drivers of biodiversity loss and a major threat to human health, particularly affecting the most vulnerable people and ecosystems[^”1”]. The demand for safe wastewater reuse is expected to outpace the ability to produce reclaimed water, with the risk that untreated wastewater is used[^”1”].
48% of the world’s wastewater still enters the environment without adequate treatment[^”1”].

## Calculations

In 2015, it was estimated that the annual production of wastewater, primarily from municipal sources, to be 370 billion m³[^”1”]. 48% of that (the amount that is not being treated[^”1”].) is 178 billion m³ annually. With a capital cost of constructing a wastewater system at $1 million per 207,251 m³ per year[^”2”] that adds up to $859 billion. With an expected life cycle of 50 years[^”3”], the cost is measured out at $17 billion annually.
For valuation of water reuse we use the global value of irrigation water of $0.13 m³[^”4”], which adds up to $23 billion worth of water saved annually, assuming all of the treated water is reused.

## Implementation

Possible barriers include lack of political attractiveness, lack of data in some areas, social/cultural acceptance, and unstable governance and regulations[^”1”].
