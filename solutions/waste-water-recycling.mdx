## Description

## Background
Only 11% of the estimated total of domestic and industrial wastewater produced is currently being reused[^”1”].
Untreated wastewater is one of the key drivers of biodiversity loss and a major threat to human health, particularly affecting the most vulnerable people and ecosystems[^”1”]. The demand for safe wastewater reuse is expected to outpace the ability to produce reclaimed water, with the risk that untreated wastewater is used[^”1”].

48% of the world’s wastewater still enters the environment without adequate treatment[^”1”].

## Calculations

Globally, wastewater and sludge management are responsible for 257 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents, In addition, 267 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents from on-site sanitation[^”1”].

In 2015, it was estimated that the annual production of wastewater, primarily from municipal sources, to be 370 billion m3[^”1”].

Humans collectively emit 54.59 billion tons of GHG emissions[^”2”]. The wastewater industry accounts for approximately 1.6% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions[^”3”].

## Implementation
Possible barriers include lack of political attractiveness, lack of data in some areas, social/cultural acceptance, and unstable governance and regulations[^”1”].
