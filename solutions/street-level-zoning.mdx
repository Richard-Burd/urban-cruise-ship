## Description
We promote street-level zoning, whereby residents on a single street or city block can vote on development decisions. This should promote more affordable housing, increase walkability, expand land use applications, and promote the overall well-being of residents.


## Background
Street and block votes should prove a popular means of increasing development in lower-density areas with high housing costs, while respecting existing rights and without disrupting existing successful processes for upzoning[^”1”].

American zoning regulations typically prevent the formation of walking-friendly urban physical environments by promoting single, exclusive land use[^”2”].

Land use regulation through zoning is an important measure for promoting walking activity because it controls the physical forms of cities, including density, land use, and development scale[^”2”].


## Calculations


## Implementation
This proposal may be put forward by planners, beyond the realm of politics, but it should ideally receive political support and, indeed, is structured to maximize political upside[^”1”]. Street and block votes would be a minor supplement to existing zoning procedures, requiring minimal amendments to local law[^”1”].
