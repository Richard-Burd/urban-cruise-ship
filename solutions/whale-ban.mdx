## Description
We recommend the International Whaling Commission (IWC) ban special permit whaling for scientific research.

## Background
Whales improve the ocean’s ability to absorb carbon. They increase the nutrient densities of the waters they travel through, resulting in blooms of phytoplankton which are responsible for half of the oxygen production of the planet and capture 40% of all CO₂ produced. [^"2"]
- The IWC banned whaling in 1986 but allowed certain exceptions, such as for scientific research. Countries such as Norway, Iceland, and Japan have used this exemption to continue whaling. [^"6"]
- Lethal scientific research methods on marine life have been made obsolete by advances in science and technology. [^"8"]

The whaling industry continues to survive:
- Japan, after its withdrawal from the IWC, continues to hunt whales in its own waters. [^"18"]
- The Japanese government is investing in the whaling industry despite decreasing demand. [^"15"]
- The Japanese whaling industry has launched whale vending machines in hopes of increasing demand which has continued to fall in Japan. [^"16"] [^"17"]
- Norway set a quota of over 900 whales to be hunted in 2022. [^"13"]
- Much of Iceland's demand for whale meat comes from the tourist industry, where the meat is billed as a traditional dish. [^"19"]

The above calculation is based upon the preservation of the total catch from Norway and Iceland in 2022.
- Great whales provide an economic value of over $2 million USD. [^"2"]
- They sequester an average of 33 tons of CO₂, the same as 1,500 trees, over their lifetime  [^"2"]

## Implementation
Article 5 of the IWC is concerned with the provision for scientific whaling. In order to amend this article, a ¾ majority vote is required. [^"14"] One strategy to secure international agreement could be to increase political pressure through education, and specifically as part of an adaptive management strategy for whale-watching organizations. [^"21"] 

Further work can be done to prevent ship strikes, establish marine protected areas, and otherwise support the rebuilding of whale populations to pre-industrial levels.
- Rebuilding all whale populations would store 8.7 million tons CO₂. [^"20"]
- Phytoplankton capture is 37 billion metric tons CO₂ captured per year. Whales bring minerals and nutrients to the ocean surface, along with their waste. We believe a restored whale population would increase the phytoplankton by at least 1%, which means at least a 370 million ton increase in CO₂ capture. [^"2"]
