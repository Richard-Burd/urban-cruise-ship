Lost or discarded fishing gear constitutes nearly half of the plastic waste in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

Discarded fishing gear is a particularly insidious form of plastic pollution because the gear can catch sea life even after discard, a phenomenon known as"ghost fishing" [^{ "13" }], which could be responsible for up to 30% of all fish caught by human activity [^{ "11" }].

An approach to the problem is strengthened international agreement. Such an agreement would focus on marking of fishing gear; extended producer responsibility; stronger enforcement against illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing; and other provisions [^{ "3" }]. Additionally, stronger enforcement of the London Convention [^{ "6" }] and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships [^{ "7" }] would reduce the permissible intentional or accidental loss of equipment at sea [^{ "16" }].

Improved recycling can increase the economic incentive for fishers to avoid loss of equipment [^{ "5" }].
