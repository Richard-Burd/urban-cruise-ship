## Description

We propose monitoring programs and stronger regulations with strict enforcement to address the problem of potential threats to the ozone layer.

## Background
The ozone layer is a critical component of Earth's atmosphere that protects life by absorbing most of the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Following the adoption of the Montreal Protocol in 1987[^"2"], which phased out the production and use of many ozone-depleting substances (ODS), the ozone layer has shown significant signs of recovery. However, recent ongoing threats have been revealed, including emissions from unregulated or illegal sources.
Key threats to continued ozone recovery include:  
•	Undetected emissions: Unexpected CFC-11 emissions were traced to certain regions of East Asia in the late 2010s[^"3"]. Studies like this prove that emissions of banned substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from unknown sources are out there. Better monitoring of ozone depleting is necessary and would rely on emission strength and time-integrated ozone depletion potential [^"7"].  
•	Black market trade: Illegal production, use, and trade of ODS persist, driven by demand in industries like refrigeration, air conditioning, and foam insulation. A driver of black market trade is that certain chemicals, such as HFCs that are regulated under the 2019 Kigali agreement, are legal in some countries and illegal in others, creating the potential for legal manufacture [^"1"]. A better response to this black market trade in ozone depleting chemicals is needed [^"9"]. Lax enforcement in some regions allows these illegal activities to continue unchecked.

## Calculations
Costs would include building and deploying atmospheric monitoring stations, upgrading satellites to relay information from those stations, and ongoing operation and maintenance.
Increasing regulations and enforcement would have costs of adding and training staff. Additionally, compliance incentives and a public awareness campaign could be very helpful as well.
Benefits could include a reduction in skin cancer and cataracts from reduced UV exposure and a possible boost in crop yields and the preservation of delicate ecosystems.
Enhanced trade compliance could reduce market distortions and potentially save money for legitimate industries.

## Implementation
This program would be a collaborative endeavor with the [United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)]( https://www.unep.org/topics/climate-action) and the [World Meteorological Organization (WMO)]( https://wmo.int/) to create the testing standards and stricter regulations. At the regional and national levels there will need to be cooperation from agencies such as the [Environmental Protection Agency]( https://www.epa.gov/) as well as custom authorities. The agreements to ban ozone-depleting substances will need to be worldwide, without exceptions, and will include stronger enforcement under previous agreements such as the Montreal Protocol [^"4"].
Potential funding sources could include contributions from member states of the UNEP, partnerships with international development banks such as the World Bank, and grants from environmental organizations.
Funding will need to be consistent and long term to ensure success. International cooperation may face resistance from regions with high unregulated emissions.
