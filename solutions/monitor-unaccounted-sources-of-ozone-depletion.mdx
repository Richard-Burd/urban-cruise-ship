## Description

We propose a two-part approach to addressing the problem of potential threats to the ozone layer.

## Background
While the ozone hole continues to recover, the recovery may be threatened by unreported increases in CFC-11 emissions.

First, better monitoring of ozone depleting is necessary. Such a metric would rely on emission strength and time-integrated ozone depletion potential [^"7"].

Second, a better response to black market trade in ozone depleting chemicals is needed [^"9"]. A driver of black market trade is that certain chemicals, such as HFCs that are regulated under the 2019 Kigali agreement, are legal in some countries and illegal in others, creating the potential for legal manufacture [^"1"]. 

## Implementation

It is necessary to move to agreements to ban ozone-depleting substances worldwide, without exceptions for some countries. Stronger enforcement, including under the Montreal Protocol, is also needed [^"4"].
