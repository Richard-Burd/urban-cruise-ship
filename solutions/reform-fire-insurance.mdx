## Description

We recommend reforms, such as ending subsidies and mandated coverage, for fire insurance in high-risk wildfire-prone areas. 

## Background

In the United States, the annual economic toll from wildfire, as of 2016, to be between $63.5 billion and $285 billion. Fire insurance policies should reflect the true risk of building in wildfire-prone areas, thereby naturally discouraging development when the cost of coverage is high. This could lead to fewer properties at risk, lower wildfire suppression costs, and the promotion of better land use planning and fire-resistant construction [^"1"].

When developers and homeowners are shielded from the true costs of wildfire risk through subsidized insurance or guaranteed availability of fire policies, they may be more likely to build or buy in these high-risk areas. This not only increases the potential for property loss and human casualties during wildfire events but also places a strain on firefighting resources and can lead to higher overall costs for society [^"2"].


## Implementation

Such reforms would need to be carefully considered to avoid unintended consequences, such as making insurance unaffordable for existing homeowners or leading to a lack of insurance availability. It would also be important to ensure that reforms are equitable and do not disproportionately affect lower-income households. The implementation of these reforms would likely require a combination of regulatory changes, incentives for risk reduction measures, and possibly the creation of a high-risk pool to provide coverage for those who cannot obtain it in the private market.
