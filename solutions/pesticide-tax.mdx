## Description
We propose a two-layer taxing system on pesticides that will target the most hazardous chemicals and their use to reduce their overall environmental and health impacts efficiently.

## Background
Pesticides are estimated to cost $14.66 billion in annual environmental and societal damages in the United States[^”1”]. This includes pesticide impacts on public health; livestock and livestock product losses; increased control expenses resulting from pesticide-related destruction of natural enemies and from the development of pesticide resistance in pests; crop pollination problems and honeybee losses; crop and crop product losses; bird, fish, and other wildlife losses; and governmental expenditures to reduce the environmental and social costs of the recommended application of pesticides.

By comparing the ratio of kg of pesticides used in the U.S. and the world total [^”1”] we estimate that the global cost would be $87.96 billion annually.


A straight value-added tax on pesticides would only encourage farmers to purchase more harmful pesticides. For this reason, we have chosen a combination of a Hazard Tax (based on how hazardous a pesticide is to humans and the environment, to reduce the use of the most harmful pesticides) and a Unit Tax (based on a per-hectare use, aimed at reducing the number of times a crop is sprayed)[^”2”].


## Calculations
A total of 2,661.14 metric tons of pesticides are sprayed each year[^”3”]. On average 2.69 kg of pesticide is sprayed per hectare of cropland[^”4”]. Therefore a Unit Tax of $27.36[^”2”] per hectare sprayed is calculated to raise $24.55 million annually.

A 250-hectare mixed-use farm was found to average 4,414.1 Hazard Points per year[^”2”]. A levy of  $2.50 per Hazard Point[^”2”] would then raise $39.61 million per year.

Together these two taxes would equal $64.16 million.

In 2021 the global pesticide market was valued at $218.24 billion[^”5”]. These taxes would reduce pesticide use by .028% by price elasticity of demand[^”6”], that would equal a $24.63 million benefit reduction of the environmental and societal costs of pesticides outlined above.

Similar to the taxation structure in Denmark[^”7”], we assume that the cost of maintaining and monitoring these taxes would equal 40% of the taxes raised or $25.66 million.

## Implementation
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is currently the entity most equipped to handle the registration and taxation of pesticides on a global scale, possibly in conjunction with the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP). Currently, the World Health Organization recommends classifying pesticides by hazard[^”8”]. Their hazard ratings only account for human hazards and lack the environmental hazard ratings outlined by Falconer & Hodge[^”2”]. This would be a significant upgrade and could also be used as a method to decide a level at which a pesticide should be banned from being produced or used. Many pesticides are banned in some countries but not in others[^”9”]. This would create a unified registry of pesticides and prevent the export of banned pesticides which has become an ethical issue[^”10”].

We recommend that this taxation solution be implemented alongside an integrated pest management solution that promotes farming practices to reduce the overall need for pesticides.
