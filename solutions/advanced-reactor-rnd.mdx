We estimate that a concerted effort on the part of the Department of Energy to commercialize an advanced reactor technology would cost $11.5 billion and have about an expected $33 billion in benefit.

Bringing an advanced reactor to market would cost an estimated $5.25 billion public and $6.25 billion private funding, or $11.5 billion today over 25 years [^"6"].

For benefit, we assume that an advanced reactor would cost 6¢/kWh, as in our levelized cost analysis, would emit 0.285¢/kWh of greenhouse gases, and would have 0.31¢/kWh of other externalities. These figures are as above, but we assume zero cost for meltdown risk from an advanced reactor. See our analysis of research and development for more information.
