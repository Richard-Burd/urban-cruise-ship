## Description
We promote the research, development, and commercialization of advanced reactor technologies.

## Background
The leading Generation IV advanced reactor energy systems are: Gas-cooled Fast Reactors, Lead-cooled Fast Reactors, Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors, Molten Salt Reactors, Supercritical Water-cooled Reactors, and Very High Temperature Reactors[^”1”]. Currently prototypes are being built in China, U.S., Russia, and France[^”1”].

Current research and development goals are technological innovation in reactor designs, new market design opportunities, design flexibility with thermal efficiency, reduction in volume and toxicity of radioactive waste, and improved sustainability[^”1”].

## Calculations
Bringing an advanced reactor to market would cost an estimated $5.25 billion public and $6.25 billion private funding, or $11.5 billion over 25 years [^"2"].
For benefit, we assume that an advanced reactor would cost 6¢/kWh, as in our levelized cost analysis, would have lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions valued at 0.285¢/kWh at a carbon dioxide valuation of $50/ton, and would have 0.31¢/kWh of other externalities. These figures are as above, but we assume zero cost for meltdown risk from an advanced reactor. See our analysis of [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) for more information.

## Implementation
Advanced reactor technology would be commercialized by private industry with help from the Department of Energy.

All current reactor technologies in the U.S. have been developed with public and private partnerships [^"3"]. Demonstration reactors may need to be built to advance nuclear technology and deployment [^"3"].
