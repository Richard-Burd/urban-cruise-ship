## Description
We propose that the United States Department of Energy, in parternship with the private sector, conduct research and development into advanced nuclear reactor designs.

## Background
As discussed above, the leading Generation IV advanced reactor energy systems are gas-cooled fast reactors, lead-cooled fast reactors, sodium-cooled fast reactors, molten salt reactors, supercritical water-cooled reactors, and very high temperature reactors [^"1"]. Currently prototypes are being built in China, U.S., Russia, and France [^"1"].

Current research and development goals are technological innovation in reactor designs, new market design opportunities, design flexibility with thermal efficiency, reduction in volume and toxicity of radioactive waste, and improved sustainability [^"1"].

## Calculations
Bringing an advanced reactor to market would cost an estimated $5.25 billion public and $6.25 billion private funding, or $11.5 billion over 25 years [^"2"]. We assume this spending is spread evenly over 25 years at a 7% discount rate.

We estimate an eventual cost of 6¢ per kilowatt-hour for advanced reactors [^"2"], and our model forecasts that, after the 25 year research period, advanced reactors will undercut energy sources with a higher levelized cost of electricity. We model 50 years from the commercialization of the technology to its reaching its market potential. Undercutting other energy sources brings about a $1.1 billion/year financial benefit, a reduction of 26 million tons of greenhouse gases, and $1.5 billion benefit from reducing other pollutants and other negative externalities of power generation, all annualized at a 7% discount rate.

These figures are based on a lifecycle carbon intensity of 57 grams/kWh and external costs (excluding greenhouse gas emissions) of 0.31¢/kWh, and they are the same as for other nuclear power, except we assume zero risk of meltdown and radiation release. The levelized cost of other forms of electricity are derived from the U.S. Energy Information Administration [^"r4"], and lifecycle greenhouse gases for existing power plants is taken from Roser [^"r5"]. For non-greenhouse gas external costs of power, see our discussions of other energy sources.

Our deployment model is based on world electricity shares in 2018 [^"r1"] and the 2019 overall generation, derived from the Statistical Review of World Energy [^"r2"]. Overall electricity consumption is expected to rise, as forecast by the U.S. Energy Information Administration's International Energy Outlook [^"r3"].

Based on experience in the pharmaceutical industry [^"r6"], we estimate that an R&D effort has a 4.9% chance of success. Thus our benefits should be taken as expected values.

## Implementation

ThorCon is working to build a molten salt reactor in Indonesia, and they aim for a cost point of 3¢/kWh and walkaway safety in the event of overheating [^"4"].

Advanced reactor technology would be commercialized by private industry with help from the Department of Energy.

All current reactor technologies in the U.S. have been developed with public and private partnerships [^"3"]. Demonstration reactors may need to be built to advance nuclear technology and deployment [^"3"].

Any new kind of nuclear power is likely to experience the same problems as contemporary light water reactors unless problems of poor regulations and industry misincentives are addressed [^"5"].
