## Description
We promote the research, development, and commercialization of Advanced Reactor technologies.

## Background
Advanced reactors are assumed to take 25 years to develop and commercialize.

## Calculations
Bringing an advanced reactor to market would cost an estimated $5.25 billion public and $6.25 billion private funding, or $11.5 billion today over 25 years[^”1”].
For benefit, we assume that an advanced reactor would cost 6¢/kWh, as in our levelized cost analysis, would emit 0.285¢/kWh of greenhouse gases, and would have 0.31¢/kWh of other externalities. These figures are as above, but we assume zero cost for meltdown risk from an advanced reactor. See our analysis of [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) for more information.

## Implementation
The Department of Energy would commercialize Advanced Reactor technology.

All current reactor technologies in the U.S. have been developed with public and private partnerships[^”2”]. Demonstration reactors may need to be built to advance nuclear technology and deployment[^”2”].
