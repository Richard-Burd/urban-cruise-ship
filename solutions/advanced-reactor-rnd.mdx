## Background

At a time of heightened concerns about climate change, nuclear energy has been struggling worldwide despite its low carbon intensity. There are two complementary approaches to revitalizing the industry: regulatory and structural reforms that will reverse the trend of rising nuclear costs of conventional light water reactors, and new designs--which we collectively call advanced reactors--that will reduce the need for complex cooling systems and eliminate the risk of meltdown. High temperature gas-cooled reactors in particular are of interest due to their ability to produce high-grade heat, which is useful for thermochemical production of hydrogen, district heating, and other industrial processes [^"12"].

As discussed above, the leading Generation IV advanced reactor energy systems are gas-cooled fast reactors, lead-cooled fast reactors, sodium-cooled fast reactors, molten salt reactors, supercritical water-cooled reactors, and very high temperature reactors [^"1"]. Currently prototypes are being built in China, U.S., Russia, and France [^"1"].

Current research and development goals are technological innovation in reactor designs, new market design opportunities, design flexibility with thermal efficiency, reduction in volume and toxicity of radioactive waste, and improved sustainability [^"1"].

## Calculations
Bringing an advanced reactor to market would cost an estimated $5.25 billion public and $6.25 billion private funding, or $11.5 billion over 25 years [^"2"]. We assume this spending is spread evenly over 25 years at a 7% discount rate.

We estimate an eventual cost of 6¢ per kilowatt-hour for advanced reactors [^"2"] after the 25 year research period. Undercutting other energy sources brings about a $3.7 billion/year financial benefit, a reduction of 18 million tons of greenhouse gases, and $5.3 billion/year benefit from reducing other pollutants and other negative externalities of power generation, all annualized at a 7% discount rate.

These figures are based on a lifecycle carbon intensity of 57 grams/kWh and external costs (excluding greenhouse gas emissions) of 0.31¢/kWh, and they are the same as for other nuclear power, except we assume zero risk of meltdown and radiation release.

See our analysis of [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) for more information.

## Implementation

All current reactor technologies in the U.S. have been developed with public and private partnerships [^"3"]. Demonstration reactors may need to be built to advance nuclear technology and deployment [^"3"].

ThorCon is working to build a molten salt reactor in Indonesia, and they aim for a cost point of 3¢/kWh and walkaway safety in the event of overheating [^"4"]. In 2020, The United States Department of Energy, though the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program [^"9"] awarded two grants to build demonstration reactors [^"6"]. One was for Terrapower's Natrium design, which uses molten salt rather than water as a coolant and thereby eliminates the need for a complex cooling system [^"7"]. The other was for X-energy's Xe-100, which uses a pebble bed fuel design [^"8"]. The Department of Energy has awarded smaller grants to reduce risks and simplify designs [^"11"].

In the past, many advanced reactor projects have failed to gain market share. For example,Transatomic Power's molten salt design was found to be unable to consume nuclear waste as the company had hoped, and Transatomic ceased operations and open-sourced their technology in 2018 [^"10"].

Any new kind of nuclear power is likely to experience the same problems as contemporary light water reactors unless problems of poor regulations and industry misincentives are addressed [^"5"].
