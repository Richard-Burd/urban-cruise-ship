## Description
We propose greater investment into climate adaptation.

## Background
Climate change is already occurring, and under any plausible emissions scenario, it will continue to intensify for at least several decades. Therefore, there is a need to invest in adaptation, and many investments could be made with positive cost/benefit structures. The following costs and benefits for select projects have been found.

## Implementation
Wealthy countries will need to make more grants available. At the 2009 Copenhagen summit, wealthy countries pledged $100 billion per year by 2020 to help poorer countries with adaptation, but by 2019, spending was only at $80 billion per year, much of which was in the form of loans rather than grants [^"2"], [^"25"].
