## Background

Adaptation is a general term for measures to reduce the negative impacts of climate change that are distinct from mitigation, or reduction of climate change itself [^"17"]. Historically, adaptation was controversially seen as creating a "moral hazard" against mitigation [^"19"]; as a solution that would benefit wealthier countries, which have a greater ability to pay for adaptation [^"18"]; or even as a surrender to climate change [^"21"].

However, recent research suggests that adaptation increases the salience of climate change among the public and contributes to, rather than detracts from, mitigation [^"20"]. Under any plausible emissions scenario, climate change will continue to intensify for at least several decades, thus necessitating adaptation.

## Calculations

Our calculations are based on a 2019 study by the World Resources Institue and the Global Commission on Adaptation [^"2"]. They assess five priority areas for adaptation investment, which are not presented as a comprehensive enumeration of all profitable investment areas. Early warning systems have been demonstrated to save lives from natural disasters such as hurricanes [^"6"], which may be becoming more severe under climate change [^"7"]. Mangroves has been shown to attenuate coastal storm strength [^"8"]. Climate change may exacerbate droughts, increasing the need to develop drought-resistant crops [^"9"]. The demand for water is expected to increase with climate change, as are the threats to water and other kinds of infrastructure, justifying the largest investments found in the report [^"2"].

Cupać, Trbić, and Zahirović [^"10"] find mostly positive net present values for various climate mitigation policies in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Williams, Karanja Ng'ang'a, and Crespo [^"11"] find similar results among smallholders in Ghana. Similar results have been found for flood control in Mexico [^"12"], some but not all window upgrades for storm protection in Australia [^"13"], and upgraded dikes in Osaka, Japan [^"14"].

There are, nevertheless, serious methdological challenges in determining a precise estimates of the damage from climate change [^"15"] and estimating how those damages can be mitigated through adaptation measures [^"16"], leaving our figures highly uncertain.

## Implementation

At the 2009 Copenhagen summit, wealthy countries pledged $100 billion per year by 2020 to the Green Climate Fund to help poorer countries with adaptation, but by 2019, spending was only at $80 billion per year, much of which was in the form of loans rather than grants [^"1"], [^"3"]. Along with investment, it is necessary to ensure that competing interests are considered during the planning process [^"5"]. A review of adaptation plans found that plans show little consideration for non-climatic factors and neglect issues of adaptive capacity [^"4"].

It is difficult to identify which investments are specifically for climate adaptation, as opposed to other purposes, allowing the banner of climate change to become a vehicle for policies that are of interest for other reasons [^"22"].
