## Background
Climate change is already occurring, including super-charged hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. Under any plausible emissions scenario, it will continue to intensify for at least several decades. Therefore, there is a need to invest in adaptation, and many investments could be made with positive cost/benefit structures. The following costs and benefits for select projects have been found.

## Implementation
Wealthy countries will need to make more grants available. At the 2009 Copenhagen summit, wealthy countries pledged $100 billion per year by 2020 to help poorer countries with adaptation, but by 2019, spending was only at $80 billion per year, much of which was in the form of loans rather than grants [^"1"], [^"3"]. While increasing investment it is important to make sure that competing interests are taken into account during the planning process[^"5"].

A review of adaptation plans found results suggesting that current adaptation plans are under-developed, showing little consideration for non-climatic factors and neglecting issues of adaptive capacity[^"4"]. This leaves a lot of room for improvement in future adaptation plans.
