## Description
We propose public funding for the establishment of collection infrastructure of e-waste. With proper collection, economics should support higher recycling rates.


## Background
Electronic waste constitutes 2-5% of the MSW waste stream[^”1”].

More than 70% of retired electronic devices end up in storage for 3-5 years before disposal[^”1”].

Recycling plants have the potential to be profitable, before accounting for environmental benefits, as has been shown for a hypothetical model in Egypt.

#### Source: [^"2"]. Figures for Year 5 are presented and rounded to the nearest $1000, so total profit is not exactly equal to the sum of all revenues and expenses.


## Calculations
Collection and transportation is estimated to represent 80% of the total cost of recycling e-waste[^”1”].


## Implementation
