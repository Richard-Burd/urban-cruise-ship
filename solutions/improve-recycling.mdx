## Background
Electronic waste constitutes about 3% of the municipal solid waste stream [^"6"],[^"7"].


## Calculations
Of 54 million tonnes of e-waste produced globally every year, 83%, or 44 million tonnes, is not recycled [^"6"]. The total value of world e-waste is reported at $62.5 billion [^"3"], and so we estimate a value of $52 billion for the portion that is not recycled.

The average cost to recycle e-waste is $450-1000 per ton, compared to $150-250/ton to landfill [^”5”], and for our calculations we use a mean additional cost of $525/ton, or $23 billion to collect and process the remaining e-waste annually.

The current rate of e-waste recycling prevents 15 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e [^”4”], implying an additional potential 71 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e reduction from the remaining waste. This is valued at $3.6 billion using a social cost of carbon of $50/ton and included in our calculations.

As e-waste recycling rates increase, we expect that the per-ton cost of additional recycling will increase and the benefit will decrease, placing practical limits on the feasible recycling rate. These cost and benefit curves are difficult to model. As a simplification, we assume that cost and benefits remain constant with increasing recycling rates, and that the maximum feasible recycling rate is 59%, which was recently achieved in Switzerland [^"8"].

Costs to human health from improper recycling are not quantified but are significant [^"10"].

Costs and benefits are rounded to the nearest billion dollars, and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction is rounded to the nearest million tonnes.

## Implementation

Public investment in e-waste recycling is necessary because, in most jurisdictions, collection and management of waste is a public operation. There is also public interest in securing the critical minerals that can be recovered from e-waste. Recent successful projects that can serve as a model for future projects include a private battery recycling facility that was supported by a loan from the United States Department of Energy [^"14"].

Achieving high rates of e-waste recycling will require a suite of policies. In addition to development of recycling facilities, extended producer responsibility, which is a policy that creates financial liability for producers of electronics to insure they are recycled, will increase recycling rates [^"9"]. Public outreach to insure recycling of electronics among the general population is also needed [^"11"], such as with convenient locations for electronics drop-offs [^"12"].

The United States is one of the few countries that has not ratified the Basel Convention on Hazardous Wastes, which among other things would prohibit the exportation of e-waste to lower income countries. Ratification of the Basel Convention would discourage exportation and improper recycling [^"13"].
