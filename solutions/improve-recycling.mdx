## Description
We propose public funding for the establishment of collection and processing infrastructure of e-waste.

## Background
Electronic waste constitutes 2-5% of the MSW waste stream[^”1”]. 
More than 70% of retired electronic devices end up in storage for 3-5 years before disposal[^”1”].

## Calculations
53.6 million metric tons of e-waste is produced globally every year[^”2”]. 83% of that is not collected for recycling[^”2”], leaving 44.49 million tons that needs to be collected and recycled.

The remaining e-waste is valued at $51.88 billion[^”3”].

The current rate of e-waste recycling prevents 15 million tons of CO₂e[^”4”], that means there is the potential of 70.8 million tons of CO2e reduction from the remaining waste. Valued at $50 per ton, that equals $3.5 billion.

The average cost to recycle e-waste is $725 per ton[^”5”], or $32.26 billion to collect and process the remaining e-waste annually.

## Implementation
As well as establishing collection and processing infrastructure, incentives and regulations may be required to realize its full potential[^”2”].
