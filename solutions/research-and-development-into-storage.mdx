## Description
We recommend the Department of Energy to fund research and development for promising energy storage options, and for legislatures to develop policy frameworks to support the deployment and integration of long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies.

## Background:
The U.S. energy grid is undergoing a transition toward renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. While these sources are clean and sustainable, they are intermittent, meaning they do not always generate power when demand is high. The shift to renewable energy sources requires the deployment of LDES technologies capable of storing energy for hours, days, weeks, and even seasons to address the inherent intermittency of energy sources such as wind and solar. Continued research and development are essential to improve performance and reduce the costs of emerging LDES technologies [^"1"].

LDES has the following benefits[^"3"],[^"4"]:  
•	Reduces reliance on fossil fuel-based peaker plants, lowering greenhouse gas emissions.  
•	Enhances grid reliability and resilience, particularly during extreme weather events.  
•	Enables higher renewable energy penetration, reducing curtailment of excess energy.  
•	Provides economic benefits through job creation in research, manufacturing, and deployment.

The following is a list of the currently most promising LDES technologies[^"2"],[^"4"]:  
- Pumped Hydro Storage – Currently the most widely deployed LDES, but site-dependent.  
- Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) – Uses underground reservoirs; limited by geological availability.  
- Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES) – Converts air to liquid for storage and re-expansion; scalable and location-flexible.  
- Flow Batteries – Vanadium and iron-based batteries are promising for grid-scale storage due to long cycle life.  
- Thermal Energy Storage – Stores excess energy as heat for later conversion; suitable for industrial applications.  
- Gravity-Based Storage – Uses cranes or mountains to lift and drop weights, generating electricity.

Among these, pumped hydro, flow batteries, and CAES are closest to large-scale deployment, while LAES and gravity storage are emerging contenders.

## Calculations
[DOE’s ARPA-E]( https://arpa-e.energy.gov/programs-and-initiatives/view-all-programs) has allocated over $330 million for various LDES and related projects and initiatives.

[BloombergNEF]( https://about.bnef.com/energy-transition-investment/) estimates that private sector investments in LDES have exceeded $1.3 billion in 2022.

Establishing federal/state-level LDES incentives and grid integration policies could cost $50-$150 million per year in administrative and regulatory processes[^"3"].

A fully deployed LDES system to support 70% renewable grid integration could cost $350-$600 per kWh[^"4"].

Reducing reliance on fossil fuel peaker plants would save in operational costs[^"6"].
Expanding LDES deployment would create jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance.

##Implementation
The [U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]( https://www.energy.gov/) would lead R&D funding and policy coordination and with further programs like their [Energy Storage Grand Challenge]( https://www.energy.gov/energy-storage-grand-challenge/energy-storage-grand-challenge). The [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)]( https://www.ferc.gov/)  would stablish grid integration regulations. The [National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)]( https://www.nrel.gov/)  would conduct technology assessments, State Energy Offices & Public Utility Commissions would implement policy frameworks, and Utilities would deploy and operate the storage technologies.

LDES must reach below $150/kWh to compete with lithium-ion storage[^"5"].
