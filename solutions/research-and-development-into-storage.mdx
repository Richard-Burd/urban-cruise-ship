## Description
We recommend the Department of Energy to fund research and development for promising energy storage options, and for legislatures to develop policy frameworks to support the deployment and integration of long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies.

## Background:
The U.S. electricity system's shift to renewable energy sources requires the deployment of LDES technologies capable of storing energy for hours, days, weeks, and even seasons to address the inherent intermittency of energy sources such as wind and solar. Continued research and development are essential to improve the performance and reduce the costs of emerging LDES technologies [^"1"].
California estimates that achieving a 60% renewable penetration by 2030 will require 2-11 GW of LDES with at least 10 hours of duration. The benefits of LDES include enhanced grid reliability, reduced reliance on fossil fuel peaker plants, improved energy equity, and the potential to significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions [^"1"].
