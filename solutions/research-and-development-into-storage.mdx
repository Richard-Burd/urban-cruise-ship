## Description
We recommend the Department of Energy to fund research and development for promising energy storage options, and for legislatures to develop policy frameworks to support the deployment and integration of long-duration energy storage technologies.

## Background:
The U.S. energy grid is undergoing a transition toward renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. While these sources are clean and sustainable, they are intermittent, meaning they do not always generate power when demand is high. The shift to renewable energy sources requires the deployment of LDES technologies capable of storing energy for hours, days, weeks, and even seasons to address the inherent intermittency of energy sources such as wind and solar. Continued research and development are essential to improve performance and reduce the costs of emerging long-duration energy storage technologies [^"1"].

Long-duration energy storage will enable higher renewable energy penetration by reducing the need for uneconomic curtailment and reliance of gas-fired peaker plants. It will also improve grid reliability during extreme weather events [^"3"],[^"4"]. At present, pumped hydro is the most widestread form of long-term storage, but that and compressed air are limited by geologic availability. Liquid air energy storage, flow batteries, and gravity-based storage--using mountains or cranes to raise and lower weights--are emerging possibilities. Thermal energy storage, which uses excess heat at storage, is suitable for industrial applications [^"2"],[^"4"].

## Calculations
[DOEâ€™s ARPA-E](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/programs-and-initiatives/view-all-programs) has allocated over $330 million for various long-duration energy storage and related projects and initiatives.

[BloombergNEF](https://about.bnef.com/energy-transition-investment/) estimates that private sector investments in long-duration energy storage have exceeded $1.3 billion in 2022.

Establishing federal and state-level long-duration energy storage incentives and grid integration policies could cost $50-$150 million per year in administrative and regulatory processes [^"3"].

A fully deployed long-duration energy storage system to support 70% renewable grid integration could cost between $350 and $600 per kWh of capacity [^"4"].

Reducing reliance on fossil fuel peaker plants would save in operational costs [^"6"].
Expanding long-duration energy storage deployment would create jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance.

## Implementation
The [U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)](https://www.energy.gov/) would lead R&D funding and policy coordination and with further programs like their [Energy Storage Grand Challenge](https://www.energy.gov/energy-storage-grand-challenge/energy-storage-grand-challenge). The [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)](https://www.ferc.gov/) would stablish grid integration regulations. The [National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)](https://www.nrel.gov/) would conduct technology assessments. State energy offices and public utility commissions would implement policy frameworks, and utilities would deploy and operate the storage technologies.

Long-duration energy storage must reach below $150 per kilowatt-hour of capacity to compete with lithium-ion storage [^"5"].
