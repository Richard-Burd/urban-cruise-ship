## Description


We recommend world governments increase spending on peacebuilding efforts.


## Background


Although there are ongoing armed conflicts in the world as of 2021, the world has been relatively peaceful, and especially without great power conflicts, since 1991, relative to other times in history. Beyond the obvious humanitarian cost of war, a major war would require substantial energy input and likely damage the political impetus behind emissions reductions.

The United States' post-9/11 violent conflict:
- Killed at least 929,000 people killed, of which were 387,000 civilians [^"3"]
- Displaced 38 million people [^"3"]
- Released 141 MMTCO2e since March 2003 in Iraq alone [^"4"] 

In addition, the US military alone releases an average of 70 million tons of greenhouse gasses per year, and the US Department of Defense is the single largest consumer of oil in the world. [^"3"] Increasing investment in peacebuilding efforts could decrease the amount of current emissions and prevent the large emissions associated with a violent conflict. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is claimed to have released 33 million tons of greenhouse gasses, and rebuilding is predicted to create an additional 49 million tons. [^"7"]

Using a case study on the peacebuilding efforts in Rwanda, the IEP estimates a benefit-over-cost ratio of 16:1 for peacebuilding efforts. [^"5"] Assuming the models are only 50%  accurate, the ratio is still 4:1 benefit-over-cost. [^"8"]

## Implementation


Peacebuilding efforts can benefit from a holistic approach that involves not only governmental sectors, but also civilian and private sectors. This approach can give a better view of the correct actions needed, and address the root causes of conflicts such as poverty and resource limitations.
