## Background

Although there are ongoing armed conflicts in the world as of 2021, the world has been relatively peaceful, and especially without great power conflicts, since 1991, relative to other times in history. Beyond the obvious humanitarian cost of war, a major war would require substantial energy input and damage the political impetus behind emissions reductions.

The United States' post-9/11 conflicts are estimated to have killed 929,000 people, of whom 387,000 were civilians, displaced 38 million [^"2"], and the war in Iraq is estimated to have released 141 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> [^"4"].

In addition, the United States military releases 70 million tons of greenhouse gasses per year, and the U.S. Department of Defense is the largest consumer of oil in the world [^"2"]. Increased investment in peacebuilding efforts would decrease these emissions and prevent the large emissions associated with a violent conflict. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is claimed to have released 33 million tons of greenhouse gases as of November 202, and rebuilding is predicted to create an additional 49 million tons [^"7"].

Using a case study on the peacebuilding efforts in Rwanda, the IEP estimates a benefit-over-cost ratio of 16:1 for peacebuilding efforts [^"5"]. Assuming the models are only 50% accurate, the ratio is still 4:1 benefit-over-cost [^"8"].

## Calculations

The United Nations peacekeeping budget for the 2021-2022 fiscal year was $6.4 billion  [^"10"]. Using the above 4:1 benefit-over-cost ratio that would have a benefit of $25.6 billion of reduced costs of war.
It was estimated that in 2019 the global economic impact of violence was $14.4 trillion dollars [^"11"], meaning there is still a very large spending gap towards peacekeeping efforts.

## Implementation

Peacebuilding efforts can benefit from a holistic approach that involves not only governmental sectors, but also civilian and private sectors. This approach can give a better view of the correct actions needed and addresses the root causes of conflicts such as poverty and resource limitations.
The average economic cost of violence in the ten most conflict-affected countries is equal to 41% of their gross domestic product [^"11"]. While the focus on these countries may be more on the lines of conflict resolution and peacebuilding, many other countries could contribute with a realignment of investments. For example, while the U.S. was the largest contributor to the UN peacekeeping budget giving about $1.8 billion, it will spend $849.8 billion on its military [^"12"].
