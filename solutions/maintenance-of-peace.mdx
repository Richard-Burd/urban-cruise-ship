export const solution = "Maintenance of Peace";

Although there are ongoing armed conflicts in the world as of 2021, the world has been relatively peaceful, and especially without great power conflicts, since 1991, relative to other times in history. It is important to maintain these conditions. Beyond the obvious humanitarian cost of war, a major war would require substantial energy input and likely damage the political impetus behind emissions reductions.
