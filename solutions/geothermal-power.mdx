## Description


We recommend world governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders accelerate investment into the research, development, and deployment of enhanced geothermal power plants as opposed to fossil fuel plants as part of a strategy to transition to net-zero emissions by 2050.


## Background


Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) generate power by extracting heat from deep underground.[^"1"] This is accomplished by drilling a deep well, known as an injection well into the rock and injecting water at high pressure to create a network of fractures. After the reservoir has been created, another well is drilled known as the production well. This well is used to extract the hot water that has been injected in the previous step. The fluid can then be recycled through the system.[^"13"]


EGS differs from conventional geothermal in that it does not depend on a naturally occurring reservoir of underground heated water[^"13"], which greatly expands the possible locations for EGS plants.

Geothermal can serve as a grid stabilizer in an increasingly renewable power grid. Wind and solar are inherently intermittent sources of energy, whereas geothermal provides a constant and consistent baseload power supply.[^"4"] 


Other benefits of EGS include:
- Low land use compared to other renewables[^"1"]
- No fuel requirements[^"4"]
- Low water demands due to closed-loop water cycling[^"4"]


- Similar to thermodynamic principles used by nuclear and fossil fuel plants[^"18"]
- Hybridization possibilities into other purposes such as hydrogen production or mineral recovery including: [^"4"]
– Zinc[^"29"]
– Lead[^"29"]
– Copper[^"29"]
– Rare Earths[^"29"]
– Silica[^"29"]
– Lithium[^"29"]


The United States’ geothermal capacity could power the entire country 4 times over if all the resources were used and would be accessible in most states, however, there is a need for [further research](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/geothermal#research-and-development-into-enhanced-geothermal).[^"4"]




These systems face challenges due to their exploratory nature. The upfront capital costs can be high as wells are not guaranteed to be viable, and other wells will have to be drilled until the correct conditions are met. Deep well drilling possess the risk of environmental and human impact, and so regulatory oversight slows the process and increases the time required for projects. There is more work needed in order to make geothermal more commercially available.[^"4"]


Earthquakes and increased seismic activity have been another cause of project delays and cancellations.[^"15"] Studies in Finland have shown limited interaction between seismic activity and fluid injection, with a proportionate amount of seismic energy and hydraulic energy input, and seismic activity is not time-delayed.[^"19"] However, an earthquake in South Korea that injured ~70 people and caused extensive damage[^"25"] has been associated with a nearby EGS project. Researchers believe that the fluid injection added pressure to an existing at-risk fault line, pushing it over the tipping point and triggering the seismic event.[^"22"] 


Assessing seismic risk should be part of EGS deployment. Switzerland’s mitigation plan for induced seismicity involves limiting the areas of hydraulically stimulated fracture planes and avoiding densely populated areas and at-risk faultlines. [^"20"] Japan’s Beyond-Brittle Project seeks to utilize ductile basements, rock formations characterized by their ability to deform in response to stress without fracturing.[^"27"] Deep closed-loop geothermal wells could also provide a solution to seismic risks as well as broaden the range of potential sites to global levels.[^"28"]

Avoided gas energy benefits were calculated using an average LCOE of $70 USD per MWh. We set CO²e emissions at 430kg/MWh[^"12"] for gas-fired plants, and 33 kg/MWh[^"30"] for geothermal to determine avoided [social carbon costs](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e).




## Implementation


Work must be done to increase geothermal’s viability. For this scenario, we use a $60/MWh instead of the current $80 average[^"12"]. We estimate that $8.3 billion USD of [Research and Development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/geothermal#research-and-development-into-enhanced-geothermal)  will need to be conducted to bring the costs down.


Permitting barriers slowed geothermal development, and the technology has not benefited from streamlining procedures that oil and gas companies are afforded. We recommend the United States streamline [geothermal permitting](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/geothermal#streamline-geothermal-permitting).
