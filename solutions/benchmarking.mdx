## Description
We propose the formation of global industrial energy benchmarking.

## Background
Energy benchmarking is a process of evaluating and comparing the energy performance of buildings using standardized metrics [^"2"]. In general it measures a building's energy consumption and compares it to similar buildings as well as established efficiency standards [^"2"]. This can identify opportunities for energy savings, tracks performance over time, and encourages energy efficient improvements to buildings [^"2"]. 

## Calculations
It is estimated that a global benchmarking system would reduce energy consumption by approximately 32.5 exajoules [^"1"].

Benchmarking can have short paybacks and high returns for companies. The following financial benefits of participating in the Superior Energy Performance program have been identified.

#### Cost estimates for a company to participate in the SEP are estimated by Therkelsen et al. [^"14"], while benefits are derived from Therkelsen et al. and reported by Maldonado [^"12"].

Although costs are study averages, larger firms tend to show higher costs and smaller firms show smaller costs.


## Implementation
An organization would need to be formed, most likely under the [United Nations Industrial Development Organization](https://www.unido.org/). A benchmarking software program or tool would need to be created or selected, for example the [Energy Star](https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/benchmark) program is the most widely used in the U.S. Data would be collected, normalized based on external variable factors, and then analyzed and compared [^"2"]. Then reports are created that allow individuals or governing bodies to make decisions based on the data to make improvements. With all of the data collection there will need to be care taken to safeguard sensitive information.
