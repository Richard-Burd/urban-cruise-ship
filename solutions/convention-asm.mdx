## Description
Following the Collegium Ramazzini, we propose that the United Nations establish a Convention on the Safety and Health of ASM, which would establish standards on safety, health, and environmental protection for artisanal mining [^"1"].


## Background
Artisanal and small-scale mining is a growing sector that produces up to 20% of global minerals and metals[^”2”].

Mining generally ranks in the top three occupations for related diseases and fatal accidents[^”2”].

Health and safety issues in the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector have not been fully addressed by governments or regulatory institutions, in part because ASM activities often take place in rural areas and can operate outside the bounds of a state’s legal frameworks[^”2”]. The majority of ASM-related accidents, fatalities, and ailments are likely undocumented, and as a result are underrepresented in national and international statistics[^”2”].

Health effects related to chemical exposure, such as mercury (Hg), cobalt (Co), arsenic (As), and lead (Pb), including neurological, renal, and autoimmune disorders, have been reported in occupationally and non-occupationally exposed individuals in ASM settings[^”3”].


## Calculations
It is currently estimated that ASM activities are practiced by more than 40 million people in over 120 countries[^”3”], and 150 million people are dependent upon the ASM industry[^”4”].

Up to 50% of ASM miners are women and 10% are children[^”3”].

70–80% of ASM workers are informal citizens or illegal immigrants in many countries[^”3”].

ASM has a considerable global share in the supply of sapphire (80%), tantalum (26%), tin (25%), gold (20%), and diamonds (20%)[^”2”].

## Implementation
Future research in ASM settings should address vulnerable groups, such as women of reproductive age and children, and health more comprehensively, including the potential spread of infectious diseases, and effects on mental health and well-being[^”3”].
