## Description
We propose a database, like SatHub, as outlined at the SATCON 2 Workshop[^”1”] to keep track of satellite positions and reduce interference with observations and experiments.

## Background
SatHub is envisioned as a database that includes properties of all satellites in orbit, so that astronomers can more easily correct for their visual impact on observations[^”1”].
The impact of these satellite constellations on astronomy and the night sky depends strongly on the brightness of their constituent satellites, which is a complex function of time, attitude, orbital position, and wavelength[^”2”]. Satellites can reflect enough sunlight to be visible to the unaided eye[^”2”].  This impact extends out to longer wavelengths, with thermal emission at infrared wavelengths, and spurious emission at microwave and radio wavelengths[^”2”].

## Calculations


## Implementation
SatHub would be funded through a combination of a public source, such as the National Science Foundation or NASA; by the satellite industry; and by the astronomical community.

[Reducing artificial light pollution](https://urban-cruise-ship.vercel.app/cities/cities_energy_and_pollution/light#light-pollution-led) on the earth could also reduce reflected light off of satellites.
