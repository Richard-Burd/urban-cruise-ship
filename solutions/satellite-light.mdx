We propose a database, like SatHub, as outlined at the SATCON 2 Workshop [^1]. SatHub is envisioned as a database that includes properties of all satellites in orbit, so that astronomers can more easily correct for their visual impact on observations. SatHub would be funded through a combination of a public source, such as the National Science Foundation or NASA; by the satellite industry; and by the astronomical community.
