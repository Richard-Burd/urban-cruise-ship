## Description
We propose expanding plant-based alternative products into "food deserts" and underserved areas to improve public health while reducing the environmental impacts of animal based agriculture.

## Background
Animal-based products have well-documented environmental and health drawbacks. Livestock farming accounts for approximately 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions[^"1"], contributing significantly to climate change. Additionally, it is a leading cause of deforestation, water pollution, and biodiversity loss[^"2"]. On a personal health level, excessive consumption of red and processed meats has been linked to increased risks of heart disease, certain cancers, and obesity[^"3"],[^"4"].

Meanwhile, millions of people, particularly in urban and rural “food deserts,” lack access to nutritious and affordable foods. These areas often have limited availability of fresh fruits, vegetables, and plant-based alternatives, leading to diets high in processed foods that exacerbate health disparities.

Expanding the availability of plant-based alternatives can address these issues. These foods require fewer resources to produce, generate lower greenhouse gas emissions, and offer healthier options compared to animal-based products. Making them accessible and affordable in underserved areas could improve public health while reducing environmental impacts.

## Calculations
Approximately 23.5 million people live in "food deserts" in the U.S. [^"7"]. Assuming they eat three meals per day that would be 25.76 billion meals per year. We aim to serve about 40% of this need, or just over 100 million meals per year.

To meet this goal, we assume a need of 50 additional plant-based food production facilities. With each facility costing approximately $10 million to establish[^"5"],[^"6"], and assuming a five year period to spread the cost for the program to reach fruition, with a 7% discount rate that would be around $121.95 million annually. Added to that is the operation and maintenance cost of $2.5 million per facility[^"5"],[^"6"], or $125 million for all 50 facilities annually.

To lower the retail price for these low-income areas we propose a subsidy of $1 per meal, adding $100 million annually to bring the total cost to $346.95 million per year. 

Distribution transportation and logistics would add additional costs, especially as these underserved areas may provide unique challenges, however those costs have not been calculated for this scenario.

An average person consuming a meat-based diet produces about 7.2 kg of CO₂ equivalent per day, while a vegan diet produces approximately 3.8 kg[^"8"], resulting in a reduction of 3.4 kg of CO₂ for every three meals replaced, or 1.13 kg per meal. That amounts to 1.25 million tons of CO₂ reduction annually for the 100 million meals per year. With a [Social Cost of Carbon](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) set at $141.4 per ton that comes to $176.75 million annually.

Adopting a plant-based diet has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers, all of which are prevalent conditions in underserved communities and contribute significantly to healthcare expenditures[^"9"]. A recent study found that the adoption of a plant-based diet in England would save $146.33 per person in healthcare costs annually[^"10"]. Assuming that providing 100 million plant-based meals would be equal to adopting a plant-based diet for 91,324 people per year that would mean a savings of $13.36 million.

Staffing 50 plant-based food production facilities would create around 5,000 direct jobs[^"6"]. Applying an employment modifier of 2.91[^"11"] we estimate that an additional 14,550 indirect jobs will be created. It is estimated that for every $1 spent in manufacturing, there is a beneficial economic impact of $2.69 to the overall economy[^"12"]. Thus our annual expenditure of $125 million on the manufacturing facilities would create an economic benefit of $336.25 million.

## Implementation
Already established plant-based companies such as [Beyond Meat]( https://www.beyondmeat.com/en-US/products/) and [Impossible Foods]( https://impossiblefoods.com/) can provide at the least expertise and at the most join in on this endeavor. Organizations such as [Feeding America](https://give.feedingamerica.org/) and [Food Research & Action Center]( https://frac.org/) can assist with food distribution. Local governments and health departments can support this endeavor through grants and policy changes.

Partial funding would be possible through government grants like the USDA's [Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program]( https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/gusnip-grant-program). Private investments through partnerships with corporations committed to sustainability and health initiatives and contributions from philanthropic foundations could fill in any gaps.

Some populations may be hesitant to adopt plant-based alternatives due to cultural preferences or misconceptions and there may be logistical challenges ensuring consistent supply chains to remote or underserved locations[^"9"].
