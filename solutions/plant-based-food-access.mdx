## Description
We propose expanding plant-based alternative products into "food deserts" and underserved areas to improve public health while reducing the environmental impacts of animal based agriculture.


## Background
Animal-based products have well-documented environmental and health drawbacks. Livestock farming accounts for approximately 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions[^"1"], contributing significantly to climate change. Additionally, it is a leading cause of deforestation, water pollution, and biodiversity loss[^"2"]. On a personal health level, excessive consumption of red and processed meats has been linked to increased risks of heart disease, certain cancers, and obesity[^"3"],[^"4"].

Meanwhile, millions of people, particularly in urban and rural “food deserts,” lack access to nutritious and affordable foods. These areas often have limited availability of fresh fruits, vegetables, and plant-based alternatives, leading to diets high in processed foods that exacerbate health disparities.

Expanding the availability of plant-based alternatives can address these issues. These foods require fewer resources to produce, generate lower greenhouse gas emissions, and offer healthier options compared to animal-based products. Making them accessible and affordable in underserved areas could improve public health while reducing environmental impacts.

## Calculations
Approximately 23.5 million people live in "food deserts" in the U.S. [^"7"]. Assuming they eat three meals per day that would be 25.73 billion meals per year. We aim to serve about 40% of this need, or just over 10 billion meals per year.


An average person consuming a meat-based diet produces about 7.2 kg of CO₂ equivalent per day, while a vegan diet produces approximately 3.8 kg[^"8"], resulting in a reduction of 3.4 kg of CO₂ for every three meals replaced, or 1.13 kg per meal. That amounts to 11.3 million tons of CO₂ reduction annually for the 10 billion meals per year. With a [Social Cost of Carbon]( https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) set at $141.4 per ton that comes to $1.6 billion annually.

Adopting a plant-based diet has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers, all of which are prevalent conditions in underserved communities and contribute significantly to healthcare expenditures[^"9"]. A recent study found that the adoption of a plant-based diet in England would save $146.33 per person in healthcare costs annually[^"10"]. Assuming that providing 10 billion plant-based meals would be equal to adopting a plant-based diet for 9,132,420 people per year that would mean a savings of $1.34 billion.


## Implementation
Already established plant-based companies such as [Beyond Meat]( https://www.beyondmeat.com/en-US/products/) and [Impossible Foods]( https://impossiblefoods.com/) can provide at the least expertise and at the most join in on this endeavor. Organizations such as [Feeding America](https://give.feedingamerica.org/) and [Food Research & Action Center]( https://frac.org/) can assist with food distribution. Local governments and health departments can support this endeavor through grants and policy changes.

Partial funding would be possible through government grants like the USDA's [Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program]( https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/gusnip-grant-program). Private investments through partnerships with corporations committed to sustainability and health initiatives and contributions from philanthropic foundations could fill in any gaps.

Some populations may be hesitant to adopt plant-based alternatives due to cultural preferences or misconceptions and there may be logistical challenges ensuring consistent supply chains to remote or underserved locations[^"9"].
