We estimate the expected benefit of enhanced geothermal research to be about $48 billion and the cost about $8 billion. The cost assumes 10 years of further research, at an annual cost the same as a [wave energy](/energy/energy_production/mhk) program of $830 million per year. The final price of enhanced geothermal power is estimated at 6 Â¢/kWh, with the same life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and other externalities as other forms of geothermal power. See our analysis of [research and development](/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) for more information.

The benefit of research may be greater if the resulting enhanced geothermal energy is also be used for direct heat.

Research priorities include better characterization of the subsurface heat map, better drill bits, and more usage of supercritical fluids [^"4"].
