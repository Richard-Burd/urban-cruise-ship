## Background
The energy reserves in the uppermost 10 kilometers of the earth’s crust are enough to supply global energy needs for approximately 217 million years [^"1"].

Research priorities include better characterization of the subsurface heat map, better drill bits, and more usage of supercritical fluids [^"2"]. Developing more accurate thermal reservoir simulation models will ensure sufficient thermal reservoir volume, and reduce fluid loss and seismic events [^"3"].

In countries with rich geothermal resources, geothermal sites can produce more than 2 megawatts-equivalent from each wel, resulting in an electricity generation cost of 7-10¢ per kilowatt-hour, cheaper than the electricity price of local utilities [^"1"].

## Calculations
We estimate the expected benefit of enhanced geothermal research to be about $48 billion and the cost about $8 billion. The cost assumes 10 years of further research, at an annual cost the same as a [wave energy](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/mhk) program of $830 million per year. The final price of enhanced geothermal power is estimated at 6 ¢/kWh, with the same life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and other externalities as other forms of geothermal power. See our analysis of [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) for more information.

## Implementation
More policy support will be needed to ensure commercialization of EGS [^"3"]. The benefits of this research may be greater if the resulting enhanced geothermal energy is also used for direct heating. Though less than those of fossil fuel power, the environmental impacts of enhanced geothermal are of concern [^"4"].
