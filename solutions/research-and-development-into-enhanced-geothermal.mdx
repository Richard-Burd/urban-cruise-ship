## Description
We recommend investing in research and development of enhanced geothermal production.

## Background
Research priorities include better characterization of the subsurface heat map, better drill bits, and more usage of supercritical fluids[^”1”].

## Calculations
We estimate the expected benefit of enhanced geothermal research to be about $48 billion and the cost about $8 billion. The cost assumes 10 years of further research, at an annual cost the same as a [wave energy](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/mhk) program of $830 million per year. The final price of enhanced geothermal power is estimated at 6 ¢/kWh, with the same life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and other externalities as other forms of geothermal power. See our analysis of [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) for more information.

## Implementation
The benefits of this research may be greater if the resulting enhanced geothermal energy is also used for direct heating.
