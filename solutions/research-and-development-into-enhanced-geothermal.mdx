## Background
The energy reserves in the uppermost 10km of the earth’s crust are enough to supply global energy needs for approximately 217 million years[^”1”]. The crucial issue currently to make use of those energy reserves in the poor productivity and efficiency of current geothermal systems and their associated risks.

Research priorities include better characterization of the subsurface heat map, better drill bits, and more usage of supercritical fluids[^”2”]. Developing more accurate thermal reservoir simulation models will ensure sufficient thermal reservoir volume, and reduce fluid loss and seismic events[^”3”].

In countries with rich geothermal resources, geothermal sites can produce more than 2MWe from each well[^”1”]. This results in an electricity generation cost of 0.07-0.10 USD/kWh, which is cheaper than the electricity price of local utilities[^”1”].

## Calculations
We estimate the expected benefit of enhanced geothermal research to be about $48 billion and the cost about $8 billion. The cost assumes 10 years of further research, at an annual cost the same as a [wave energy](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/mhk) program of $830 million per year. The final price of enhanced geothermal power is estimated at 6 ¢/kWh, with the same life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and other externalities as other forms of geothermal power. See our analysis of [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) for more information.

## Implementation
More policy support will be needed to ensure commercialization of EGS[^”3”]. The benefits of this research may be greater if the resulting enhanced geothermal energy is also used for direct heating.

While life cycle assessment of environmental impact is significantly lower than conventional fossil fuel and nuclear based power plants, it is higher when compared to other renewable energy sources[^”4”]. These environmental impacts will need to be reduced to be competitive and for long term sustainability.
