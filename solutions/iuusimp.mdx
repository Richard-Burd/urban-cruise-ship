## Description

We recommend a world treaty to enhance reporting and enforcement of laws against illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.

## Background

IUU fishing, which comprises up to a fifth of all fishing by value [^"7"], contributes to organized crime, overfishing, damage to coral reefs, and other forms of ecological damage [^"6"]. IUU fishing also costs the livelihood of legitimiate fishing operations and costs governments tax revenue [^"3"].

An example of an effecive monitoring program is the Seafood Import Monitoring Program in the United States [^"1"], which establishes recordkeeping requirements for almost half of U.S. seafood imports.

## Calculations

We estimate the following costs and benefits to IUU monitoring and enforcement.

Total IUU catch is hard to estimate by its nature, but it has been estimated at 11-26 million metric tons of seafood [^"2"]. The total damages of IUU is estimated at $26-50 billion/year [^"3"]. Given that IUU seafood has a market value of $9-17 billion/year, the net cost is $9-41 billion/year, with the median cost of $26 billion used in the calculations above. The costs assessed are those to legitimate fishers and governments; ecological costs and costs associated with organized crime, while significant, are not quantified here.

The Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency was found to reduce IUU tuna catch in the Pacific by 46%; we use this reduction for IUU catch broadly in our calculations. Thus the median net benefit to reducing IUU catch is about $11 billion/year.

To estimate the cost of monitoring and enforcement, we note that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration proposed to spend $85 million on IUU enforcement for fiscal year 2024 [^"4"]. The United States comprises 3.6% of world seafood comsumption by calories [^"5"], and so world enforcement cost would be $2.4 billion/year if all countries show the same cost to consumption ratio.

## Implementation

The two main prongs of a successful counter to IUU fishing are monitoring and enforcement. Monitoring tools consist of molecular genetics, vessel tracking, remote electronic monitoring [^"8"], and a public database of legitimate fishing vessels [^"10"]. Effective enforcement measures includes better staffing with enforcement agencies and patrolling of IUU hotspots [^"9"]. International agreement is also needed to share information and prevent vessels with illegal catch from docking at any port around the world [^"9"].
