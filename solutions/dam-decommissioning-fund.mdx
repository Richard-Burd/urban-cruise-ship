## Description

We propose that Congress establish a Dam Decommissioning Fund, to finance dam removal projects where economically and environmentally justified, financed by a construction by a fee on new dam construction. The fee would be equal to an estimated discounted cost of eventually decommissioning the new dam.

## Calculations

The benefits of a dam decommissioning fund are internalizing what is presently the external cost of a dam's eventual decommissioning. The International Energy Agency reports that $127 billion, or nearly a quarter, of hydropower capital expenditures from 2021 to 2030 will go to refurbishment [^"1"]. We therefore take the capital expenses of new dam construction to be $38.1 billion per year. Decommissioning of a dam typically costs 20-40% of construction cost [^"2"]; we use 30% for the purposes of this calculation. A Dam Decommissioning Fund would internalize $230 million per year, assuming 80 year dam lifetimes and a 5% discount rate.

We estimate the administration cost of the bonding program to be 1% of the (undiscounted) value of the bond [^"3"], or about $114 million per year.

## Implementation

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) may have the authority to impose the creation of a Dam Decommissioning Fund, which would be funded by dam operators and passed to ratepayers as part of the price of electricity. Such a fund would be modeled after the waste disposal fee imposed on operators of nuclear power plants. Although FERC may have the legal authority to establish a Dam Decommissioning Fund, an explicit act of Congress would bring clarity.

Most dams to be constructed in the future are anticipated to be located in what are now low-income countries [^"1"]. Therefore, the full benefit of Dam Decommissioning Funds will require similar action to establish them in all countries that will build dams.
