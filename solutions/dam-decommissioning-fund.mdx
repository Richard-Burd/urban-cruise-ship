export const problem = "Cost of Dam Removal";
export const solution = "Dam Decommissioning Fund";

We propose that Congress establish a Dam Decommissioning Fund, to finance dam removal projects where economically and environmentally justified, financed by a construction by a fee on new dam construction. The fee would be equal to an estimated discounted cost of eventually decomissioning the new dam.
