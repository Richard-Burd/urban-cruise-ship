We propose that Congress establish a Dam Decommissioning Fund, to finance dam removal projects where economically and environmentally justified, financed by a construction by a fee on new dam construction. The fee would be equal to an estimated discounted cost of eventually decomissioning the new dam.

<b>Benefits:</b> The benefits of a dam decommissioning fund are in the form of internalizing what is presently the external cost of a dam's eventual decommissioning. The International Energy Agency reports that $127 billion, or nearly a quarter, of hydropower capital expenditures from 2021 to 2030 will go to refurbishment [^"1"]. We therefore take the capital expenses of new dam construction to be $38.1 billion per year. Decommissioning of a dam typically costs 20-40% of construction cost [^"2"]; we use 30% for the purposes of this calculation. Assuming a discount rate of 3% and a dam lifespan of 50 years, the discounted decommissioning cost is about $2.61 billion.

<b>Cost:</b> We estimate the administration cost of the bonding program to be 1% of the (undiscounted) value of the bond [^"3"], or about $114 million.

<b>Implementation:</b> The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) may have the authority to impose the creation of a Dam Decommissioning Fund, which would be funded by dam operators and passed to ratepayers as part of the price of electricity. Such a fund would be modeled after the waste disposal fee imposed on operators of nuclear power plants. Although FERC may have the legal authority to establish a Dam Decommissioning Fund, an act of Congress explicity authorizing this would be welcome legal clarity to the matter.

Most dams to be constructed in the future are anticipated to be located in what are now low-income countries [^"1"]. Therefore, the full benefit of Dam Decommissioning Funds will require similar action to establish them in all countries that operate dams.
