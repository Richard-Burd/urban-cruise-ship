We propose the creation of a Strategic Propellant Reserve, modeled after the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as proposed by Bruno et al. A Strategic Propellant Reserve would place propellant, created from lunar ice, in low-Earth orbit, near recti-linear halo orbit, the lunar surface, and in Mars orbit, to facilitate refuelling in space and longer, cheaper spacecraft journeys [^"7"].
