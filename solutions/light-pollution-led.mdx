## Description

We recommend local governments, world governments, and other stakeholders invest in LED lighting with full cut-off shielding or retrofit existing lighting to block unnecessary skyward illumination.

## Background

Light pollution impacts star visibility, but the adverse effects of light pollution extend to human and animal mental and physical health as well as the environment. [^"1"] This form of pollution is often taken less seriously than other forms, as it is often considered an aesthetic issue. Many people living in areas with high levels of light pollution are never able to benefit from the ability to stargaze. [^"3"] However, for many cultures, the loss of starlight has profound detrimental effects, especially those whose traditions are deeply involved with the stars. [^"2"] [^"9"] 

There is no clear link between brightness and increased safety, and in some cases, the opposite has been found. [^"6"] Research has found that the use of artificial light at levels similar to full moon illumination with a warm-white color temperature of 2700K to 2200K is most preferred by survey respondents. While estimating what energy could be saved by reducing the brightness of over-illuminated areas is difficult, the savings would be substantial. [^"4"] 

Artificial light is disruptive to animals and insects especially those who operate nocturnally. LED lights allow for more control over lighting which can help to reduce the impact on ecological systems. [^"11"]

Full cutoff shielding can reduce average city sky glow and can be further enhanced by reducing illumination in over-illuminated areas. By using these practices, research indicates a 42–88% reduction in sky glow. [^"5"] 

Street lighting can represent 40-45% of a municipality's total energy costs. [^"12"]



## Calculations

Using an estimate of $440 per light for LED with cut-off shielding replacement, we can get a rough idea of the cost it would take to retrofit the worlds lights with ones that reduce sky glow. [^"20"]

Number of streetlights world wide
352m [^"7"] 

The total cost then would be 154.88 Billion to do retrofitting total

2.2 billion per year wasted light in the US. [^"18"]

We will estimate 55 million street lights in the US [^"19"]

So that would be $40 per light a year per light is wasted due to unnecessary skyward illumination in the US

Extrapolation to a worldwide scale results in 14.08 billion of of energy savings per year due only to the element of wasted skyward illumination. 



Next I will need to estimate other benefits and monetize them. 

Other Savings due to switching to LEDs, carbon footprint savings. Possible ecological benefits?




## Implementation

Six case studies regarding the transition to LED street lights provide resources for municipalities seeking to transition to LED technologies. [^"15"] In many cities, the process is already underway as more people are realizing the cost savings of this technology, but it must be coupled with environmental considerations. [^"16"]
