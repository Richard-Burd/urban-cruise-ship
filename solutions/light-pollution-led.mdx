## Description


We recommend local governments, world governments, and other stakeholders accelerate investment in LED lighting with full cut-off shielding or retrofit existing lighting to block unnecessary skyward illumination.


## Background


Light pollution impacts star visibility, but the adverse effects of light pollution extend to human and animal mental and physical health as well as the environment. [^"1"] This form of pollution is often taken less seriously than other forms, as it is often considered an aesthetic issue. Many people living in areas with high levels of light pollution can never benefit from the ability to stargaze. [^"3"] However, for many cultures, the loss of starlight has profound detrimental effects, especially those whose traditions are deeply involved with the stars. [^"2"] [^"9"]


There is no clear link between brightness and increased safety, and in some cases, the opposite has been found. [^"6"] Research has found that the use of artificial light at levels similar to full moon illumination with a warm-white color temperature of 2700K to 2200K is most preferred by survey respondents. While estimating what energy could be saved by reducing the brightness of over-illuminated areas is beyond the scope of this report, the savings would be substantial. [^"4"]


Artificial light is disruptive to animals and insects especially those who operate nocturnally. LED lights allow for more control over lighting which can help to reduce the impact on ecological systems. [^"11"]


It is estimated that the United States wastes 22,000 gigawatt hours ($2.2 billion USD) on skyward illumination per year. [^"18"] Full cutoff shielding can reduce average city sky glow and can be further enhanced by reducing illumination in over-illuminated areas, resulting in a 42-88% reduction in sky glow. [^"5"]


Street lighting can represent 40-45% of a municipality's total energy costs. [^"12"]

As of this report, half of the world-wide residential lighting market uses LED technology.[^"22"] Total adoption for city illumination is still unclear, however the adoption of these technologies is on the rise. [^"12"]

Using an estimate of $440 per light for LED with cut-off shielding replacement[^"20"], we can get a rough estimate of $154.88 billion USD total to retrofit the world's 352 million streetlights (spread out over a period of 10 years, the minimum expected lifespan of the lights)[^"7"]

LED lights use approximately 75% less energy than conventional streetlights. [^"21"] For this report, we will assume that all streetlights are currently sodium vapor lamps with internal ignitors (SON), even though LED retrofitting is already being carried out, and many areas now use LED streetlights. [^"24"] Further research is needed to assess the current state of LED retrofitting.

Using a price of $0.178 USD per KWh[^"25"], we estimate the world spends $24.6 billion USD on electricity for streetlighting annually, and that would spend $5.2 billion to power LEDs.

## Implementation

Six case studies regarding the transition to LED street lights provide resources for municipalities seeking to transition to LED technologies. [^"15"] In many cities, the process is already underway as more people are realizing the cost savings of this technology, but it must be coupled with environmental considerations. [^"16"]

Additionally, warm toned with a Correlated Color Temperature of 3000 K or lower should be used to minimize light scatter. Blue / Short wavelength light contributes more to skyglow than warm / longer wavelength light. [^"10"]
