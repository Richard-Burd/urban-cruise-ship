## Description

We examine the use of biochar as a means of carbon sequestration in China.


## Background

Biochar, a carbon-rich product derived from biomass, acts as a stable carbon storage method. Its application in soils not only sequesters carbon but also improves soil health[^"4"].

Biochar production involves biomass that is heated at 300°C to 700°C in an oxygen-limited environment, producing the biochar, bio-oil and synthetic gas (which can be used in other applications). Resistance to decomposition is a unique feature of biochar from the original biomass that would just decay to release CO2 into the atmosphere within a much shorter period[^"3"].

It is then applied to the soil and worked into the ground in a process termed 'amendment'. The stored biochar can then remain for hundreds to thousands of years within the soil. This stability is derived from the fact that the carbon structure of biochar is extremely resistant to the microbial degradation that usually releases CO2 back into the air from organic materials. Biochar enhances the health of the soil through water retention, nutrient availability, and increased microbial activity. All these can lead to more increased plant growth, which will further pull more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere[^"3"].

The agricultural sector produces 5 billion metric tons of waste biomass per year, with over 70% coming from Asia[^"2"]. China expects to produce Negative Emission Technologies (NETs) capable of providing negative emissions of up to 2.91 billion tons of CO2 per year between 2050 and 2060. Biochar has been examined as a NET, which could sustainably provide 0.92 Gigatons of CO2 sequestration annually in China alone[^"1"]. Globally, biochar could sequester 2.5 gigatons per year[^"2"].

#### *Benefits derived from the [social carbon cost](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) only, without factoring in the other expected benefits to crop yields, reductions in fertilizers, water retention, and other benefits[^"1"].

Crop Yield increases ranged from 8% to 15%, depending on the crop[^"1"].

The cost of biochar production is 30% lower than of activated carbon, and is more economical than many other sequestration technologies[^"2"]. However, the cost per ton of CO2 mitigation is still higher than the generally accepted [social carbon cost](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) of $50, with a mean figure of $92.


## Implementation

The production, which involves intenstive could increase emissions if the process is left unregulated, and carbon intensive fuels are used in its production[^"2"]. Further research is needed to advance biochar to a mature technology.
