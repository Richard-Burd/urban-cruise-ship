## Description

We examine biochar for carbon sequestration in China.


## Background

Biochar, a carbon-rich product derived from biomass, is a stable carbon storage method. Its application in soils sequesters carbon and also improves soil health [^"4"].

Biochar production entails heating biomass to 300°C to 700°C in an oxygen-limited environment, which produces biochar, bio-oil and synthetic gas, which can be used in other applications. Biochar features unique resistance to decomposition and releases CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere at a much slower pace than other forms of biomass [^"3"].

Biochar is then applied to the soil and worked into the ground in a process termed 'amendment'. The stored biochar can then remain for hundreds to thousands of years within the soil. This stability results from the carbon structure of biochar that is extremely resistant to the microbial degradation that usually releases CO<sub>2</sub> into the air from organic materials. Biochar enhances the soil health through water retention, nutrient availability, and increased microbial activity. All this leads to increased plant growth, which further pulls carbon dioxide from the atmosphere [^"3"].

Agriculture produces 5 billion metric tons of waste biomass per year, with over 70% from Asia [^"2"]. China expects to produce negative emission technologies (NETs) capable of providing negative emissions of up to 2.91 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year between 2050 and 2060. Biochar could sustainably provide 920 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration annually in China alone [^"1"], with a global potential of 2.5 billion tons per year [^"2"].

#### Benefits are derived from the [social carbon cost](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) only, without factoring expected benefits to crop yields, reductions in fertilizers, water retention, and other benefits [^"1"].

Crop yields increase from 8% to 15%, depending on the crop [^"1"].

Biochar production costs 30% less than activated carbon--another frequently used soil amendment for absorption and neutralization [^"5"]--and is more economical than many other sequestration technologies [^"2"]. However, the cost per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation is still higher than the generally accepted [social carbon cost](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) of $50, with a mean figure of $92.


## Implementation

Biochar production may increase emissions if carbon intensive fuels are used [^"2"]. Further research is needed to advance biochar to a mature technology.
