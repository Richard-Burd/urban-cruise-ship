## Description




We recommend world governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders invest in solar-based power plants instead of fossil fuels as part of a strategy to transition to net-zero emissions by 2050.




## Background

Current investments in clean energy will need to triple to meet net-zero climate goals by 2050.[^"16"]


Energy in the form of sunlight that hits Earth is far greater than any projected energy needs.[^"27"] Harnessing this power has been made more cost-effective as new solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has increased efficiency in cell design.[^"2"] The price of solar power dropped 89% in the period from 2009 to 2019.[^"19"] Despite a recent rise in costs, the cost of producing solar power is expected to decrease in the coming years.[^"7"]




Solar power generation grew from 823 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2020 to 1002 TWh  in 2021, an increase of 22%. While this is a record amount of growth, more is needed to meet world energy needs.[^"2"]

Replacing fossil fuel plants with intermittent renewable such as solar involves far greater expenses with regards to grid integration, as it will have to be adapted to connect solar energy sources.[^"22"] This will involve several expenses including storage and modification of the [grid infrastructure](https://urban-cruise-ship.vercel.app/energy/energy_distribution/grid_design).[^"14"]

#### Total cost in cents represents the levelized cost of energy (takes into account the cost to build, maintain, operate, and fuel a particular power plant over its lifetime to give a true value of the cost of energy in USD per megawatt hour) for that particular plant type, taken as an average of the low and high end ranges.[^"21"]



Developing countries spend a large portion of their budgets on fossil-fuel-based energy sources. A renewable energy shift presents many obstacles including the initial investment, manufacturing, installation, and transportation. Social awareness of renewables and education can increase the likelihood of adoption. Renewables, by removing the reliance on shifting fuel prices, can help developing states gain more independence.[^"12"]

#### We set a target of 27,006 terawatt hours of solar photovoltaic electricity generation by 2050.[^"26"] We use a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) based on an unsubsidized analysis to determine power generation costs[^"21"], and apply a decline in LCOE totaling 47% by 2035[^"7"], with annual growth rates starting high to meet near-future goals[^"2"] and gradually declining,[^"7"]

Grid system costs are averaged across studies from 6 countries at a penetration level (the amount of energy provided in relation to other energy sources) of 30%[^"22"], and are broken down into four areas:
- Back-up: system resilience in the face of fluctuating demand, supply, outages, and retirement of facilities[^"22"]
- Balancing: minute-by-minute adaptability of the system to supply and demand uncertainty[^"22"]
- Grid connection: equipment and infrastructure needed to interconnect the facility to the grid including grid modifications that may be needed[^"22"]
- Grid reinforcement and extension: expanding or upgrading existing grid infrastructure to accommodate new solar energy sources[^"22"]






## Implementation


The transition to wind energy will require investment from the private sector, and support from governments to achieve the 2050 carbon-neutral goal.


While the time to obtain a permit has decreased in recent years in the United States, permitting delays remain a problem for renewables.[^"28"] Key points of opposition to renewable projects include:
- Impact on wildlife[^"29"]
- Failure to respect Trial rights[^"29"]
- Health and safety concerns[^"29"]
- Intergovernmental disputes[^"29"]
- Impacts on land and property value[^"29"]


It is important to address these concerns early in the process, particularly issues where the projects could harm to local communities.[^"29"]


Governments should create stable solar power targets that minimize future adjustments and create stable incentives. [^"17"]
