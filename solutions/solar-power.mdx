## Description




We recommend that national governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders invest in solar power plants instead of fossil fuels as part of a strategy to transition to net-zero emissions by 2050.




## Background

Current investments in clean energy will need to triple to meet net-zero climate goals by 2050 [^"16"].


The sunlight that hits Earth contains far more energy than any projected needs [^"27"]. As new solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has increased efficiency in cell design [^"2"], the price of solar power has dropped 89% from 2009 to 2019 [^"19"]. Despite a recent rise in costs, the cost of solar power is expected to decrease in the coming years [^"7"].




Solar power generation increased by 22% from 823 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2020 to 1002 TWh in 2021, a record growth, but insufficient to meet world energy needs [^"2"].

#### Solid bars indicate current data. Open bars are the projections used throughout this solution for determining costs [^"26"].


Replacing fossil fuels with intermittent solar requires greater grid integration expenditures [^"22"], including storage and modification of the [grid infrastructure](https://urban-cruise-ship.vercel.app/energy/energy_distribution/grid_design) [^"14"].

Fossil fuels are expensive for low-income countries. Challenges of a renewable energy shift include the initial investment, manufacturing, installation, and transportation. Social awareness of renewables and education can increase the likelihood of adoption. Renewables, by removing the reliance on shifting fuel prices, can help developing states gain more independence [^"12"].

#### We model 27,006 terawatt hours of solar photovoltaic electricity generation by 2050 [^"26"]. Costs are based on an subsidized levelized cost of energy (LCOE) [^"21"]. We apply a decline in LCOE of 47% by 2035 [^"7"], with annual growth rates starting high to meet near-future goals [^"2"] and gradually declining [^"7"].

#### Benefits are measured as avoided costs for generating the same energy from natural gas and coal, as well as in CO<sub>2</sub> emission. Sources: IEA [^"26"], Lazard [^"21"], Bolinger et al. [^"7"], IEA [^"2"].

Grid system costs are averaged across six countries at 30% penetration [^"22"] and include back-up, balancing, grid connection, and grid reinforcement and extension [^"22"].






## Implementation


The transition to solar energy for a 2050 carbon-neutral goal requires investment from the private sector and support from governments.

Permitting time has decreased in recent years in the United States, though permitting delays remain a problem for renewables [^"28"], with key points of opposition including wildlife impacts, tribal rights, health and safety concerns, intergovernment disputes, and land and property values [^"29"]. It is important to address these concerns early in the process, particularly issues where the projects could harm to local communities [^"29"].

Governments should create stable solar power targets that minimize future adjustments and create stable incentives [^"17"].
