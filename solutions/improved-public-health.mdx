## Description
We propose creating a Public Health Infrastructure Fund to create a more robust public health system.

## Background
The COVID-19 pandemic stressed public health systems around the world and exposed the gaps in health care for underserved and vulnerable populations[^”1”]. Focusing on health system preparedness is paramount for protecting the health of all of society. There are multiple stressors, old threats (e.g., re-emergence of measles), disruptive new technologies (e.g., electronic cigarettes), increased challenges (e.g. drug-resistant organisms), and new threats (e.g., pandemics, climate change, politicized misinformation), our health systems must be robust and resilient[^”1”].

A comprehensive national public health structure is a system devoted to disease prevention and health promotion, incorporating a variety of local, state, and federal bodies that can promote the health of populations, surveil and predict emerging health threats, and retain the agility and capacity to respond when needed to events such as pandemics[^”2”]. The U.S. public health system has been characterized as fragmented in both organization and funding sources[^”2”]. It is generally accepted that local, county, and state public health capabilities vary widely across the United States, and that a persistent funding gap remains[^”2”].

## Calculations
Foundational public health capabilities needed to promote and protect health for everyone across the nation would cost $13 per person more than what is currently being spent, or $4.3 billion[^”3”].

The estimated costs of building a public health infrastructure for delivering a population-wide evidence-based multi-level system of parenting interventions to strengthen parenting; reduce risk for child maltreatment and coercive parenting practices; and reduce the prevalence of early child behavioral and emotional problems is $12.74 per child[^”4”]. Totaling $777 million, this cost can be recovered in a single year by a 10% reduction in the rate of abuse and neglect[^”4”].


## Implementation
A Public Health Infrastructure Fund should be set up for state, territorial, local, and tribal governmental public health, that would provide permanent resources needed to fully support core public health foundational capabilities[^”3”].
Policy changes to encourage healthier choices, improved education, safe transportation, and healthy housing and other improvements to the built environment would also support public health infrastructure[^”1”].
