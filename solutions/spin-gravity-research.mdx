A year or more of microgravity exposure can cause serious health problems [^"1"], but there is no direct evidence with long-term exposure to the low gravity found on the Moon or Mars. Research in a rotating space station, such as the concept proposed by Gateway Spaceport [^"4"], would bring more clarity to the health risks.
