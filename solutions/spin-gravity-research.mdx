## Description
We propose building a rotating space station to research the long-term effects of low gravity on humans.


## Background
A year or more of microgravity exposure can cause serious health problems[^”1”], but there is no direct evidence with long-term exposure to the low gravity found on the Moon or Mars. Research in a rotating space station, such as the concept proposed by Gateway Spaceport[^”2”], would bring more clarity to the health risks.

Evidence indicates the spaceflight environment induces adverse effects on the brain, including intracranial fluid shifts, gray matter changes, and white matter declines[^”3”]. There can also be adaptive neural effects such as sensory reweighting and neural compensation[^”3”].

Other human conditions when exposed to microgravity include: sensorimotor coordination disorders, cardiovascular deconditioning, muscular atrophy, bone loss, anemia, immunodeficiency, and neuro-ocular syndrome[^”4”].
