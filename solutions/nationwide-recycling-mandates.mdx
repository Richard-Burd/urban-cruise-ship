## Description
While certain states and cities have recycling regulations, there is no nationwide minimum standard for recycling. We propose that all commercial and industrial businesses nationwide be required to recycle specified materials.

## Background
It has been found that variable pricing of waste disposal, the enactment of recycling ordinances, and cumulative expenditures on recycling education are effective measures to increase recycling rates[^”4”]. The most important determinant of household recycling is people's attitudes toward recycling[^”5”], suggesting that ongoing recycling education programs are crucial to any policy success.

## Calculations
The private marginal cost of recycling is assumed to be $89.29 per ton[^”1”].

## Implementation
Recycling services are costly and require financing from local taxpayers and/or state governments to operate[^”1”]. The importance of this is highlighted as economic resources have been found to have greater significance to program success than do either administrative design or environmental support[^”3”]. Policies with the largest recycling ratios are those that include curbside recycling[^”5”], suggesting that ease of use is crucial to policy success.
While we are advocating for a national standard, local governments should maintain the management of commercial recycling programs because of the increased public-private collaboration and cooperation required for success[^”2”].
