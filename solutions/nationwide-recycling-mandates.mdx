## Description
While certain states and cities have recycling regulations, there is no nationwide minimum standard for recycling. We propose that all commercial and industrial businesses nationwide be required to recycle specified materials.

## Background

## Calculations
The private marginal cost of recycling is assumed to be $89.29 per ton[^”1”].


## Implementation
Recycling services are costly and require financing from local taxpayers and/or state governments to operate[^”1”].
