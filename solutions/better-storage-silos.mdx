## Description
We propose to expand the use of hermetically sealed storage silos to store grains and cereals to reduce postharvest losses and contamination.

## Background
Hermetically sealed metal silos kill storage pests by oxygen deprivation without pesticides[^”1”].

The major effect of the metal silos is an almost complete elimination of losses due to insect pests, saving farmers an average of 150–200 kg of grain, worth (US$130) [^”1”]. Pest attack on stored grains is also linked to mycotoxin contamination and poisoning[^”2”].

Silo adopters were able to store their maize for 1.8–2.4 months longer, and to sell their surplus after five months at good prices, instead of having to sell right after the harvest[^”1”].

The period of inadequate food provision among adopters was reduced by more than one month[^”1”].


## Calculations

The metal silo can be fabricated in different sizes, 100 kg–3,000 kg holding capacity by trained local artisans, with the corresponding prices of $35 to $375[^”2”].

In China, the adoption of metal silos can increase the supply of rice by 626,800 t per year; save 86,600 ha of land, 29,400 t of fertilizer, and 0.82 billion m3 of water; reduce carbon emissions by 232,200 t, and meet the food consumption needs of 1.39 million people per year[^”3”].


## Implementation
Policies to increase access to credit, to reduce the cost of sheet metal, and to promote collective action can improve storage silo uptake by smallholder farmers[^”1”].
