## Description
We propose research and development into wind power generators that are able to harvest energy from hurricanes.

## Background
Although there has been interest in capturing wind energy from hurricanes [^"1"] and prototype development [^"5"] in 2021, further work is needed to realize turbines that are capable of sustaining and harvesting hurricane force winds [^"3"]. 

Computer simulations have shown that massive banks of offshore windfarms containing tens of thousands of turbines could disrupt a hurricane, reducing its impact and speed when it reaches land [^"4"]. 

This has been proposed as an alternative to sea walls which, if the turbines were harvesting energy, would be economically feasible as they would generate income and provide protection, whereas seawalls are only used to provide protection [^"4"].
