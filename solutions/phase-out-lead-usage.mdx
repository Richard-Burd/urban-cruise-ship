## Description

We propose that all national governments ban the manufacture and use of lead paint.

## Background

## Implementation

Many countries currently do not have restrictions on lead in paint, and among those that do, restrictions are mostly limits on lead concentration rather than outright bans [^"9"]. A complete elimination of lead in paint is infeasible, since lead contamination in many ingredients is unavoidable, but a standard of 90 parts per million or less, such as is recommended by the Lead Paint Alliance [^"13"], is achievable and has already been implemented by many countries [^"14"].
