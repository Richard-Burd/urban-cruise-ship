## Description




We recommend world governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders invest in wind-based power plants instead of fossil fuels as part of a strategy to transition to net-zero emissions by 2050.




## Background




2022 investments in renewable energy and increasing energy efficiency reached $1.3 trillion USD. [^"8"] Wind power saw $147 billion USD of investments in 2021, double the annual investment a decade earlier. [^"9"]  As of 2023, the majority of existing coal plants cost more to operate than new wind power and tax credits now make 99% of them less profitable than renewable sources in the United States. [^"10"]  As capacity has increased, the costs of wind power and solar have dropped.[^"19"]




Current investments in clean energy will need to triple to meet net-zero climate goals by 2050.[^"16"]




Wind power is the leading new renewable technology and is on track to outpace hydroelectric generation, generating 1870 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity in 2021.[^"2"]

Capital costs to build a new power plant ($USD per kilowatt of generation):
- Onshore wind: $1,363[^"21"]
- Offshore wind: $4,000[^"21"] (There are some predictions that offshore wind will eventually become less expensive than onshore)[^"20"]
- Natural Gas: $975[^"21"]
- Coal: $4,987[^"21"]
- Nuclear: $11,200[^"21"]


Levelized Cost of Energy (takes into account the cost to build, maintain, operate, and fuel a particular power plant over its lifetime to give a true value of the cost of energy in USD per megawatt hour):
-Wind Onshore: $24-$75 - Average: $49.50[^"21"]
-Wind Offshore: $42-$114 - Average: $78[^"21"]
-Natural Gas: $39-$101 - Average: $70[^"21"]
-Coal: $68-$166 - Average: $117[^"21"]
-Nuclear: $141-$221 - Average: $181[^"21"]




Wind power does not require fuel but is affected by many factors such as seasons, temperature, and weather, and thus fluctuates in its power output. Wind prediction and modeling will become more critical as more of the grid relies upon this energy source, and machine learning is being employed in this field to help with planning wind farm locations.[^"13"] The intermittency of wind power means that power plant grid connection will be more expensive than conventional power plants, and the grid must be adapted.[^"22"] Energy storage systems will play a key role in addressing these issues.[^"14"]

#### We set a target of 23,700 terawatt hours of wind-based energy power by 2050, based upon a mix of 83.5% onshore power and 16.5% offshore power.[^"26"] We use a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) based on an unsubsidized analysis to determine power generation costs[^"21"], and apply a decline in LCOE totaling 37% by 2050, based upon the low range of the prediction of a 37% to 49% decline[^"7"], with annual growth rates starting high to meet near-future goals[^"2"] and gradually declining,[^"7"]

Grid system costs are averaged across studies from 6 countries at a penetration level (the amount of energy provided in relation to other energy sources) of 30%[^"22"], and are broken down into four areas:
- Back-up: system resilience in the face of fluctuating demand, supply, outages, and retirement of facilities[^"22"]
- Balancing: minute-by-minute adaptability of the system to supply and demand uncertainty[^"22"]
- Grid connection: equipment and infrastructure needed to interconnect the facility to the grid including grid modifications that may be needed[^"22"]
- Grid reinforcement and extension: expanding or upgrading existing grid infrastructure to accommodate new wind energy sources[^"22"]






## Implementation


The transition to wind energy will require investment from the private sector, and support from governments to achieve the 2050 carbon-neutral goal.


Developing countries spend a large portion of their budgets on fossil-fuel-based energy sources. A renewable energy shift presents many obstacles including the initial investment, manufacturing, installation, and transportation. Social awareness of renewables and education can increase the likelihood of adoption. Renewables, by removing the reliance on shifting fuel prices, can help developing states gain more independence.[^"12"]




The high seas have some of the best wind energy resources. Floating offshore wind farms have been constructed as far as 180km from shore[^"25"],  however, there are regulatory issues regarding the deployment of wind turbines in international waters. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) or a new international authority could give permission to countries to build turbines in these areas or designate areas where turbines can be built so that they do not disrupt other ocean activities. The environmental impact of high-seas turbines should also be studied prior to deployment.[^"15"]
