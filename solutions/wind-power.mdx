## Description




We recommend that national governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders accelerate investment in wind power instead of fossil fuels to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.




## Background




In 2022, investments in renewable energy and increasing energy efficiency were $1.3 trillion [^"8"], with $147 billion for wind power in 2021, double the annual investment a decade earlier [^"9"]. As of 2023, the majority of existing coal plants cost more to operate than new wind power and tax credits now make 99% of them less profitable than renewable sources in the United States [^"10"].  As capacity has increased, the costs of wind and solar power have dropped [^"19"]. Nevertheless, investments in clean energy need to triple to meet net-zero climate goals by 2050 [^"16"].

Wind power is the leading new renewable technology and is on track to outpace hydroelectric generation, generating 1870 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity in 2021 [^"2"].

#### Solid bars indicate current data. Open bars are the projections used throughout this solution for determining costs [^"26"].

Wind power does not require fuel but is affected by many factors such as seasons, temperature, and weather, and thus fluctuates in its power output. Wind prediction and modeling will become more critical as more of the grid relies upon this energy source, and machine learning is being employed in this field to help with planning wind farm locations [^"13"]. Because of intermittency, grid connection are more expensive than conventional power plants, and the [power grid](https://urban-cruise-ship.vercel.app/energy/energy_distribution/grid_design) must be adapted [^"22"]. Energy storage systems will play a key role in addressing these issues [^"14"].

#### Costs are the levelized cost of electricity, including costs to build, maintain, operate, and fuel a particular power plant over its lifetime. For each power plant type, costs are the mean of the low and high values [^"21"].


Fossil fuels are expensive for low-income countries. Challanges with renewable energy include the initial investment, manufacturing, installation, and transportation. Social awareness of renewables and education can increase the likelihood of adoption. Renewables, by removing the reliance on shifting fuel prices, can help developing states gain more independence [^"12"].

#### We model 23,700 terawatt hours of wind power by 2050, of which 83.5% is onshore wind and 16.5% is offshore wind [^"26"]. Costs are based on an unsubsidized levelized cost of energy (LCOE) [^"21"]. The LCOE is projected to decline 37-49% to 2050, and our calculations use a decline of 37%[^"7"]. Annual growth rates starting high to meet near-future goals [^"2"] and gradually decline [^"7"].

Grid system costs are averaged across six countries at a penetration of 30% and include back-up, balancing, grid connection, and grid reinforcement and extension [^"22"].



## Implementation

The transition to wind energy will require investment from the private sector, and support from governments to achieve the 2050 carbon-neutral goal.


The high seas have some of the best wind energy resources. Floating offshore wind farms have been constructed as far as 180 kilometers from shore [^"25"], but there are regulatory issues regarding the deployment of wind turbines in international waters. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea or a new international authority could give permission to countries to build turbines in these areas or designate areas where turbines can be built so that they do not disrupt other ocean activities. The environmental impact of high-seas turbines should also be studied prior to deployment [^"15"].
