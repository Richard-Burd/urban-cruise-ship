## Description

We propose a public program of research and development to improve steam system efficiencies.

## Background

Steam systems are the single largest consumer of energy in the United States (6% of primary energy use [^"2"]), and are found in almost all manufacturing plants [^"4"]. Industrial steam consumes 11% of the freshwater used by the entire U.S. manufacturing sector [^"3"].

A comprehensive approach, including the optimization of heat recovery networks and the implementation of energy conservation measures, has been suggested as key elements for carbon emissions reduction and enhancing energy efficiency in industrial processes [^"5"].


## Implementation

Steam systems are often left unimproved, or efficiency opportunities are not taken due to initial investment requirements or because the energy savings were undercut by priorities on short-term revenue generation. Other factors include long plant downtime [^"2"]. 

Water usage and conservation should be a key metric when assessing steam system improvements [^"4"]. [Water pricing](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/matter/water/water_usage#water-pricing) could increase the mindfulness of water usage by manufacturers.
