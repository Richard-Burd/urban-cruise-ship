## Description

We propose a comprehensive public program to improve steam system efficiencies.

## Background
Steam systems are the single largest consumer of energy in the United States (6% of primary energy use [^"2"]), and are found in almost all manufacturing plants [^"4"]. Industrial steam consumes 11% of the freshwater used by the entire U.S. manufacturing sector [^"3"].

Industrial steam systems are critical to manufacturing, chemical processing, food production, and power generation. These systems use boilers to produce steam, which is then distributed through a network of pipes and used for various industrial processes. Many existing steam systems operate with inefficiencies due to outdated equipment, heat loss, poor maintenance, and suboptimal system designs.

A comprehensive approach, including the optimization of heat recovery networks and the implementation of energy conservation measures, has been suggested as key elements for carbon emissions reduction and enhancing energy efficiency in industrial processes [^"5"].

Several technologies can enhance steam system efficiency, including:  
•	Condensate Recovery Systems – Reusing condensed steam (condensate) reduces the need for new water and minimizes energy use.  
•	Boiler Economizers – Capture waste heat from flue gases to preheat incoming feedwater, improving boiler efficiency.  
•	Steam Traps and Leak Management – Regular monitoring and maintenance prevent energy losses.  
•	Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Systems – Capture excess steam energy for electricity generation.  
•	Advanced Controls and Sensors – Optimize steam distribution and demand in real time.

## Calculations
The U.S. consumed 98.74 exajoules of primary energy in 2023[^"6"], 6%[^"2"] of that is 5.92 exajoules consumed by steam systems. We estimate that comprehensive upgrades would amount to approximately 15% reduction in energy consumption[^"7"],[^"8"]. Totaling .89 exajoules of energy saved. 

The U.S. consumes 388.25 billion m³ of freshwater annually[^"9"]. Industrial steam systems account for 11%[^"3"] of that, or 42.71 billion m³ annually. We estimate that comprehensive upgrades could save around 20% on water consumption[^"10"],[^"11"], or 8.54 billion m³ reduction annually.

The U.S. emits approximately 6,343 million tons of CO₂e, of which 23% or 1,459 million tons comes from the industrial sector[^"12"]. Industrial steam systems account for approximately 37% of the industrial sectors energy use[^"8"], and assuming that a 15% reduction in energy use would translate to a 15% reduction in GHG emissions, that would equal a reduction of 81 million tons of CO₂e annually. With an estimated [Social Cost of Carbon]( https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) set at $141.40 per ton, the GHG reduction would amount to a benefit of $11.45 billion annually.


## Implementation
The estimations of energy reduction due to improvements have gone down over time, suggesting that improvements are in progress[^"7"],[^"8"]. Some factors such as long plant downtime[^"2"] can be handled through careful planning and scheduling. The U.S. DOE could set an efficiency standard or a goal to reach a certain efficiency within a certain timeframe to help boost the rate at which improvements are being made.

Utility Rebate programs such as the [Steam Trap Audit Program by Centerpoint Energy]( https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/business/save-energy-money/efficiency-programs-rebates/equipment-programs-and-rebates/steam-trap-audit) could be used to reduce the cost of upgrades.

Water usage and conservation should be a key metric when assessing steam system improvements [^"4"]. [Water pricing](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/matter/water/water_usage#water-pricing) could increase the mindfulness of water usage by manufacturers.
