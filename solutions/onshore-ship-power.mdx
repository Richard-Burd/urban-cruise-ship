## Description

We recommend the implementation of shore to ship power, also known as cold ironing, in the most commonly used ports, and for at least ¼ of the global merchant fleet be retrofitted with the ability to use shore power while in berth to avoid the use of on board fossil fuel generators for electricity.

## Background

Shore power, also known as onshore power supply (OPS) or cold ironing, allows ships to shut down their main and auxiliary engines while at berth and instead connect to an onshore electricity grid [^"1"]. This can result in up to a 90% reduction in air pollutants and a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to running the ship's engines [^"2"].

The EU provides €1.5 billion in funding to support the development of shore power infrastructure to EU ports [^"4"]. Countries like Norway, the Netherlands, and Italy have also implemented national-level policies and funding programs to drive the adoption of shore power [^"3"].

The world’s merchant fleet consist of 105,500 ships of which 56,500 were over 1000 gross tons in cargo handling capacity. For the purposes of this solution, we focus only on ships with over 1000 gross tons, and we will assume 25,000 of them are suitable for cold ironing retrofitting [^"17"]. We recommend the world's 50 busiest ports build 30 ship berths each [^"21"].

Ships spend an average of 22.7 hours berthed, and we assume each ship will make at least 20 port calls to major ports per year [^"18"]. The average ship at port requires 1,600 KW of power, consuming 7.7 tonnes of fuel, over a 24-hour span [^"16"]. Global average price for marine fuels is US$925.50 per ton [^"19"]. Each ton of marine fuel produces 3.206 tons of carbon emissions, and the avoided carbon costs are calculated by accounting for the unspent fuel [^"20"]. It is important to note that the energy source for the electricity is critical for actual emission reductions. Potential emissions due to grid energy sources are not calculated here. We use at shoreside electricity rate of US$0.11 per kilowatt-hour [^"16"].

## Implementation

Progress has been made in this area, with multiple ports and ships using this technology as of 2022 [^"12"]
There is a need for international standardization to make this realistic. Ships have a wide range of power needs and an international standard [^"7"] is needed so that ships can be reliably powered in various ports [^"4"].

Economic concerns ar one of the main challenges to implementation [^"11"], with financial constraints being cited the primary obstacle for port decarbonization by port stakeholders [^"15"]. If implemented, ships could see a return on investment within 3 years of conversion [^"14"].

As stated earlier, the shore power grid must also be taken into account with regards to the emissions it may be producing. Ideally power would be provided by renewable sources so that emissions are actually reduced instead of transferred.
