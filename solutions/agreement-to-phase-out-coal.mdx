## Description

Contemporary international climate agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, focus primarily on emissions targets, and leave it to individual countries to determine how to meet the targets. We don't expect the Paris Agreement to be much more effective than Kyoto in effecting emissions reductions. Instead, we propose that international agreements center on tangible, concrete actions, such as closing coal-fired power plants.

## Background

Even if all countries agree to their commitments in the 2015 Paris agreement, it will not be sufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 Â°C. An international treaty for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries to close all coal-fired power plants by 2030, and for all countries to do so by 2040, would be a more tangible and effective action [^"23"]. Recent data adds urgency to this phaseout; in 2021, world coal use rebounded from the COVID slump of 2020, and coal burning for electricity reached a record high [^"5"].

## Implementation

Partial progress was made toward this goal at the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow in 2021, where more than 40 countries agreed that wealthy countries would phase out coal in the 2030s and poorer countries in the 2040s [^"11"]. However, compared to the proposal described above, this timeline is later, and it was not agreed by several major coal-buring countries.
