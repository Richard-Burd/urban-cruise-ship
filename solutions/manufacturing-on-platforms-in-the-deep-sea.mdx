## Description
We propose appropriating used oil rigs, retired ships, and other stationary platforms for industrial manufacturing to reduce air pollution damage to humans and the biodiverse environments.

## Background
If the demand for oil drops as alternatives gain market share, there may be a surplus of offshore oil rigs. These rigs could be appropriated for industrial or other uses [^”1”],[^”2”],[^”3”]. Retired ships, such as the ocean linear Queen Elizabeth 2, can also be repurposed for more stationary uses [^”4”].


## Calculations

Benefits are assessed as avoided decommissioning costs, which in turn are estimated from Bull and Love [^"8"]. In particular, we cite the per-platform median of five cost estimates that Bull and Love provide, which in turn are taken from a U.S. Interior Department study [^"9"].

Costs are assessed as the required refurbishment costs of platforms for other purposes, which we estimate in particular based on an industrial desalter model from Peporini et al. [^"6"]. Figures are applied to 149 floating oil rigs platforms that were determined to be in service at the end of 2023 [^"10"] with a 7% discount rate.

## Implementation
Part of the initial investment cost could be paid for through grants, similar to the grants awarded by the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to turn an offshore platform in the Gulf Coast of the U.S. into a fish farm [^”7”].
