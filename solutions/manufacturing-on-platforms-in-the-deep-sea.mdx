## Description
We propose appropriating used oil rigs, retired ships, and other stationary platforms for industrial manufacturing to reduce air pollution damage to humans and the biodiverse environments.

## Background
If the demand for oil drops as alternatives gain market share, there may be a surplus of offshore oil rigs. These rigs could be appropriated for industrial or other uses[^”1”],[^”2”],[^”3”]. Retired ships, such as the ocean linear Queen Elizabeth 2, can also be repurposed for more stationary uses [^”4”].

In 2014 there were 395 operational offshore oil rigs, while at the end of 2023 there were 240[^”5”], meaning that there should be at least 155 non-operational offshore oil rigs.

## Calculations
It is estimated to cost $65 million per offshore oil platform to fully decommission and return the seafloor to its pre-lease condition[^”2”].

If there are at least 155 non-operational offshore oil rigs (as outlines above) then we propose to convert them over a 20-year period or about 7.75 rigs converted per year. At $65 million per platform to fully decommission (as outlined above), that would be benefit of $503.75 million of avoided cost.

Using an Industrial Desalter Plant as an example of what a platform could be turned into the initial cost of investment is estimated to be $16 million with an annual maintenance cost of $2.8 million[^”6”].

## Implementation
Part of the initial investment cost could be paid for through grants, similar to the grants awarded by the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to turn an offshore platform in the Gulf Coast of the U.S. into a fish farm[^”7”].
