## Description
We propose appropriating used oil rigs, retired ships, and other stationary platforms for industrial manufacturing to reduce air pollution damage to humans and the biodiverse environments.

## Background
If the demand for oil drops as alternatives gain market share, there may be a surplus of offshore oil rigs. These rigs could be appropriated for industrial or other uses[^”1”],[^”2”],[^”3”]. Retired ships, such as the ocean linear Queen Elizabeth 2, can also be repurposed for more stationary uses [^”4”].
In 2015 there were 1,470 offshore oil rigs around the world[^”2”].

## Calculations
It is estimated to cost $65 million per offshore oil platform to fully decommission and return the seafloor to its pre-lease condition[^”2”].


## Implementation
