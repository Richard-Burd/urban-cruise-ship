## Description

We propose an increase in agricultural research and development.

## Background

Research and development is necessary for all industries to advance, but it is particularly important in agriculture, where some R&D is necessary just to maintain yields against factors such as pesticide resistance [^"3"]. Several studies [^"4"], [^"5"], [^"6"], [^"7"] have found very positive returns for investment in agricultural research and development. Our numbers are derived from Rosegrant et al. [^"1"].

## Calculations

Rosegrant et al. [^"1"] calculate the following costs and benefits of agricultural R&D investment in the Global South.

An increase in agricultural R&D as envisioned above, compared to the counterfactual of research levels remaining constant, will result in an increase in yield of 10%, reduction of hunger by 35%, reduction of food prices by 16%, and increase in per-capita incomes by 4%. An 8% discount rate is used in these calculations. A higher discount rate will result in a less favorate benefit-cost ratio, while a lower discount rate will result in a more favorable ratio [^"1"].

Additionally, Rosegrant et al. [^"1"] find the following environmental benefits to increased research: 402 million tons CO<sub>2</sub> over 15 years reduced, 756 million tons reduced over 35 years, 0.3% and 0.9% of world water usage reduced over 15 and 35 years respectively, 21-35% reduction in nitrogen pollution, and 14-15% reduction in phosphate pollution.

The increased yields resulting from additional research will reduce the land area required for agriculture and thus save an estimated 1 million hectares of deforestation every year. Using the ecosystem service valuation of Costanza et al. [^"2"], the monetized value of this avoided deforestation is 20-40% of the total benefits assessed above. However, this value is not included in our estimates.

## Implementation

Agricultural R&D is envisioned to be conducted primarily by national governments, rising from the present baseline value of about $2 billion per year to a $6.8 billion by 2040, then tapering off after that [^"1"]. The envisioned areas of investment are broad and include genetic engineering, intercropping, extension services, better machinery, and breakthrough technologies such as CRISPR and synthetic meat [^"1"].
