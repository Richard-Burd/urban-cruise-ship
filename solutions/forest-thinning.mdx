## Description
The U.S. Forest Service should strategically remove dead underbrush from forests (forest thinning) and controlled burns to reduce the risk of wildfire.

## Background
More than 95% of the wildland fires in western ecosystems are suppressed successfully in the phase of initial attack, where their sizes cannot grow more than two acres. However, less than 4% of fires that cannot be suppressed in the early stage result in more than 95% of the burnt area and cause the majority of life and property damage[^”1”].

Tree survival was greatest in areas that had both thinning and prescribed fire prior to the wildfire event. Survival was near zero for untreated areas. Survival in thinned-only areas was greater than untreated areas but substantially less than the areas with both treatments[^”2”].

Total small mammal biomass generally increased following both thinning and wildfire[^”3”].


## Calculations


## Implementation
Prescribed fire is necessary to extend the effectiveness of thinning after significant tree or shrub regeneration. Continued monitoring will allow managers to use prescribed fire most efficiently to achieve fire and fuel management objectives[^”4”].
