## Description

We recommend expanding the use of greenhouses.

## Background

Globally, 1.9 billion people face food insecurity (inadequate access to enough food for a healthy lifestyle), and of that 767.9 million people in 2021 were undernourished (the inability to consume enough calories to meet daily energy requirements, which can lead to malnutrition).[^"6"] 
- Northern Africa: 17.4 million undernourished people[^"6"] 
- Eastern Africa: 136.4[^"6"] 
- Middle Africa: 60.7[^"6"] 
- Southern Africa: 6.3[^"6"] 
- Western Africa: 57.3[^"6"] 
- Central Asia: 2.3[^"6"] 
- South-eastern Asia: 42.8[^"6"] 
- Southern Asia: 331.6[^"6"] 
- Western Asia: 28.4[^"6"] 
- Caribbean: 7.2[^"6"] 
- Central America: 15.2[^"6"] 
- South America: 34.2[^"6"] 
- Oceania: 2.5[^"6"] 

Since 2015, the number of undernourished people has grown. The COVID-19 pandemic increased already rising global hunger as well as income inequality. Predictive models based on current trends indicate 8% of the worldâ€™s population will remain undernourished by 2030. The war in Ukraine also has the potential to increase the figure by 7.6 million people.[^"6"] 

Meeting global food needs by 2050 will require a 70% growth in food production, increasing our water usage by 53%, and requiring 38% more farmland.[^"9"] The use of greenhouses in agriculture offers an alternative for boosting food production with a fraction of the water and land needs.[^"9"] 

Greenhouse technology has evolved significantly over time, with innovations improving their efficiency and effectiveness. They are employed in various regions worldwide, enabling or enhancing agricultural production. They require less land, less water, and fewer pesticides, however, energy requirements, greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication, and acidification are still challenges that require further research and innovation.[^"9"]

While studies have shown that many greenhouses come with higher greenhouse gas emissions[^"2"], local production of foods where the alternative is shipped food could result in lower overall environmental impact and increased food security.

The National Horticulture and Livestock Productivity Project (NHLP) is a program designed to combat food insecurity in Afghanistan. This project involves the construction of greenhouses, costing $320 to build, for recipients who are in financial need and have access to the required land. This program has allowed participants to grow produce year-round.[^"8"]

## Implementation:

To implement greenhouses globally, practical considerations such as technology transfer, financial resources, and local capacity-building must be addressed. Overcoming barriers like high initial costs, access to energy, and local climatic factors is crucial. Optimizing greenhouse technologies and minimizing their environmental impact will further enhance their benefits.
