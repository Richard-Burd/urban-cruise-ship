## Description

We propose research and development into high-temperature gas reactors (HTGRs) for nuclear industrial heat, which could provide a cost-effective solution for water desalination, thermochemical production of hydrogen, and other applications.

## Background

HTGRs could serve as electricity generators as well as meeting industrial heating needs, thereby making better use of the heat generated that may not be captured by steam turbines.

New [hydrogen production methods](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_distribution/hydrogen#research-and-development-into-new-methods) involving the use of nuclear reactors have been explored. The current selling price of hydrogen is $3.70 per kilogram. A recent analysis of a helium-cooled reactor utilized in hydrogen production resulted in production prices of $4.28 per kilogram [^"1"]. [Small modular reactors](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/nuclear#small-modular-reactor-r-d-u-s) show promise to be able to provide less expensive hydrogen in the near future.

Paired with a desalination plant, high-temperature gas reactors can provide cogeneration of electricity and fresh water. Small modular reactors may be particularly useful, as smaller sized reactors paired with large desalination plants are the most advantageous. The excess heat produced by a nuclear plant can be used with electricity to desalinate water [^"2"].

## Implementation

Public acceptance is a significant barrier to the implementation of nuclear technology, including HTGRs. Concerns about safety, radioactive waste management, and potential accidents contribute to public skepticism.
