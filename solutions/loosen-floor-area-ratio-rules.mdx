## Description

We propose that cities reduce floor-area ratio rules.

Cost and benefit estimates are based on the Medium Density Residential Standard, a proposal from the national government of New Zealand, for residential upzoning [^"1"]. Impacts are scaled to the population of the United States, which is 65 times greater than that of New Zealand, and figures are converted to U.S. Dollars. The proposal would allow an additional 74 thousand homes in residential areas in New Zealand; scaled to U.S. population, that is about 4.8 million homes.

Costs and benefits are assessed on a 5-8 year horizon; the benefit-cost ratio is expected to be better on a longer horizon.


## Background

Cities choose to limit floor-area ratio (FAR) to manage congestion [^"7"], [^"33"] and other reasons. However, such rules limit floor space and drive up costs through scarcity.

FAR rules tend to be most stringent where land values are high and there is great demand for living and office space, such as Manhattan and Washington, DC [^"6"]. Hence in these areas, there is a significant loss of floor space because of regulation.

## Calculations

Costs, as applied to the United States, are estimated to be $82 billion for increased congestion, $22 billion for loss of sunshine, $18 billion for loss of views, $17 billion for environmental costs, and $84 million implementation costs.

The cost of a potential increase in crime is not assessed.

The consumer surplus benefit of lower cost housing is estimated at $43 billion. The agglomeration benefit is estimated at $231 billion.

Though not counted directly as a monetary benefit, the MRDS would result in almost 14 times as much transfer from existing property owners to renters and first-time buyers as it would generate in economic value over a 20 year span.

If applied in the United States, 4.8 million new residential units would be built with an average of 2.6 people in each unit. If commensurate increases in density occur in transportation, commercial, and institutional space, then 7,947 square kilometers of urban land would be saved. If 60% of the people living in these new developments drive and save 2.6 miles of driving per day on average [^"2"], with an average fuel economy of 24.4 miles per gallon [^"3"] and 8,887 grams of CO₂ released per gallon of gasoline [^"4"], then 2.6 million tons of CO₂ would be saved per year, valued at $130 million per year if CO₂ is priced at $50/ton.


## Implementation

This proposal would allow three story units in residential areas by right, would require that zoning allow at least six stories near commercial centers and public transit stops, and implement some other changes.

The above figures are illustrative values of increasing FAR from a single study. Should another city, region, or country choose a similar policy, they could conduct their own analysis.

Although more building space can create more traffic congestion in an area, more building space near a city center can reduce congestion by reducing the amount of distance people need to travel and hence the amount of driving. For this reason, maximum FAR rules make most sense around the city fringe, while there is a case for minimum FAR rules near a city center [^"24"].
