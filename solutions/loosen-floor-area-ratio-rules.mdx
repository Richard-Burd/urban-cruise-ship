<b>Description:</b> There are several reasons that cities might choose to limit floor-area ratio (FAR), such as to manage congestion [^"7"], [^"33"]. However, such rules come at the cost of limiting floor space and driving up costs through scarcity.

FAR rules tend to be most stringent where land values are high and there is great demand for living and office space, such as Manhattan and Washington, DC [^"6"]. Hence in these areas, there is a significant loss of floor space as a result of regulation.

Cost and benefit estimates are based on a study conducted for the government of New Zealand, studying the impact of a national residential upzoning proposal [^"1"]. Impacts are scaled to the population of the United States, which is 65 time greater than that of New Zealand, and figures are coverted to U.S. Dollars. Costs and benefits are assessed on a 5-8 year horizon; the benefit-cost ratio is expected to be better on a longer horizon.

<b>Cost:</b> Costs, as applied to the United States, are estimated to be $82 billion for increased congestion, $22 billion for loss of sunshine, $18 billion for loss of views, $17 billion for environmental costs, and $84 million implementation costs.

The cost of a potential increase in crime is not assessed.

<b>Benefits:</b> The consumer surplus benefit of lower cost housing is estimated at $43 billion. The agglomeration benefit is estimated at $231 billion.

Though not counted directly as a monetary benefit, the MRDS would result in almost 14 times as much transfer from existing property owners to renters and first time buyers as it would generate in economic value over a 20 year span.

<b>Implementation</b>: The proposal analyzed here, called the Medium Density Residential Standard would allow three storey units in residential areas by right, would require that zoning allow at least six stories near commercial centers and public transit stops, and implement some other changes.

The above figures are illustrative values of increasing FAR from a single study. Should another city, region, or country choose a similar policy, they could conduct their own analysis

Although more building space can create more traffic congestion in an area, more building space near a city center can reduce congestion by reducing the amount of distance people need to travel and hence the amount of driving. For this reason, maximum FAR rules make most sense around the city fringe, while there is a case for minimum FAR rules near a city center [^"24"].
