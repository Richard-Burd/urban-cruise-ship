## Background
The National School Lunch Program costs $14.2 billion annually and serves 4.9 billion lunches [^”1”], or about  $2.90 per lunch, of which 44.7% is food [^”2”]. 64% of food expenditures are meat, dairy, and eggs [^”3”].
In 2009 A USA Today investigation found that meat served in U.S. schools did not meet the quality or safety standards of fast-food restaurants [^”4”]. The standards were strengthened in 2010 to include more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and less salt. However, they still contain factory-farmed animal products and highly processed foods. Diets high in saturated fats from meat and dairy products are shown to impair learning and memory [^”5”]. 

## Calculations
By replacing meat with vegetable-based alternatives, $696 million would be saved to further improve the quality of meals served [^”6”],[^”7”]. This would reduce CO₂ emissions by 27.8 million tons [^”8”].

Reduced meat consumption within this range would reduce diet-related healthcare costs by 11.1% [^”9”], or $5.55 billion out of $50 billion in overall diet-related health costs [^”10”]. While this study was done on adults it is reasonable to assume that the savings would be even greater for children, especially if these changes helped to maintain healthy eating habits over their entire lifespan.

The average cost of enacting and implementing federal regulations is $13,142,857 [^”11”]. The actual cost is unknown but it should be reasonable and will be a one-time cost while the benefits will continue yearly.

## Implementation
Federal regulation would need to be passed to restructure the U.S. National School Lunch Program and the U.S. Department of Agriculture would oversee the implementation of the changes. Meat portions of the meals would be replaced with beans, legumes, nuts, seeds, and other protein-rich plant sources. This may need to come after, or in conjunction with a plant-based informational advocacy campaign to gain acceptance from the general public. There will be strong opposition from the meat industry, and the topic could become a culture war.
