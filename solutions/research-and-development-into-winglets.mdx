We recommend research, development, and deployment into winglets for wind turbines.

The energy production benefits of winglets are well-established. While there is still value for conducting additional research to optimize winglets, there are only marginal gains remaining for doing so [^"23"]. More effort should be invested on deployment than on research.

It is possible to retrofit existing turbines with winglets, and not necessary to build entirely new turbines [^"30"]. To aid in retrofitting, the Department of Energy could provide grants or low interest loans to utilities for retrofitting.
