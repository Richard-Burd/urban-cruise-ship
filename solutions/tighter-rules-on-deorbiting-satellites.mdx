## Description
We propose the use of satellite deorbiting performance bonds to prevent further satellite debris.


## Background
The historical practice of abandoning satellites, second stages, and even spacecraft at the end of their mission life has allowed over 2 million kg of accumulated debris in orbit[^"1"]. If no countermeasures are taken, the number of debris particles are expected to have a growth rate up to 5% per year[^"1"].

Orbital debris results from the interacting collection of defunct satellites and second stages of rocket launchers[^"2"]. Even millimeter-sized pieces of debris can damage or destroy a satellite which creates more debris and lowers the expected realized value of the satellite[^"2"]. 

According to voluntary guidelines governing orbital space, users are expected to deorbit their satellites within 25 years after the end of the satelliteâ€™s useful life, but because there are not adequate incentives, a majority of users do not comply[^"2"].

Deorbiting performance bonds maximize capital recoupment, since satellite operators reacquire their performance bond, plus interest, upon successful deorbiting[^"2"]. An attractive feature of performance bonds is that they can be marketable, and the holder of the bond would have a legal claim to the funds after providing sufficient evidence that the satellite is appropriately deorbited[^"2"].


## Implementation
A regulatory agency would create the bonds and place them in a zero-risk, interest-earning escrow account[^"2"]; and monitor compliance.
