## Background

The spread of light emitting diodes (LEDs) has been a great victory for energy efficiency. More progress is possible through development of a next generation of lighting technology such as laser diodes, as well as advancing the state of the art of LEDs. 

Laser diodes could be more efficient than LEDs because they don't suffer as much from the efficiency loss which happens in LEDs as the current increases. This drop results in a reduction of luminance achievable per diode [^"1"]. In order to achieve greater luminance, the physical size of the LED must also be greater, whereas laser diodes do not require such drastic increases in size for luminance [^"3"].

LED technology can also be improved. The first LEDs were limited in the range of colors they were able to produce. The use of rare earth elements has provided a way for other colors to be produced by LEDs. New advancements in material science may allow for a better range of color emission without the need for rare earth elements [^"2"]. 

## Calculations
In 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy requested $348 million for R&D into energy reduction in buildings, with most funds to go to lighting [^"4"]. By comparison, $277 million was requested for facilities and infrastructure for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy [^"4"].

The Department of Energy attributes $20 billion of avoided energy costs to the Solid-state Lighting Programs LED by the adoption market model [^"5"]. It is also estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 79 million metric tonnes annually [^"5"], with a social cost of carbon valued at $140.4, to add $11 billion in annual benefits.

## Implementation

Further research and development is needed in all lighting areas. Laser diodes must be modified so that they are capable of producing diffuse light [^"3"].
