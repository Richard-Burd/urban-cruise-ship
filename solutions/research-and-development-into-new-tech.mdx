## Background

The spread of LED lighting has been a great victory for energy efficiency. More progress is possible through development of a next generation of lighting technology such as laser diodes, as well as advancing the state of the art of light emitting diodes (LEDs). 

Laser diodes could be more efficient than LEDs because they don't suffer as much from the efficiency loss which happens in LEDs as the current increases. This drop results in a reduction of luminance achievable per diode [^"1"]. In order to achieve greater luminance, the physical size of the LED must also be greater, whereas laser diodes do not require such drastic increases in size for luminance [^"3"].

LED technology can also be improved. The first LEDs were limited in the range of colors they were able to produce. The use of rare earth elements has provided a way for other colors to be produced by LEDs. New advancements in material science may allow for a better range of color emission without the need for rare earth elements [^"2"]. 

## Calculations
In 2024 the U.S. Department of Energy requested $348 million for R&D into energy reduction in buildings which is mostly lighting technologies[^"4"]. Facilities and infrastructure for the whole Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy department requested $277 million[^"4"].

Attributed to the DoE Solid-state Lighting Programs LED adoption market model is $20 billion in avoided energy costs annually[^"5"]. It is also estimated to reduce CO₂ emissions by 79 million metric tonnes annually[^"5"], with a social cost of carbon valued at $140.4 per ton that adds $11 billion in annual benefits.

## Implementation

Further research and development is needed in all lighting areas. Laser diodes must be modified so that they are capable of producing diffuse light [^"3"].
