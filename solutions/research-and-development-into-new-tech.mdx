## Description

We recommend continued research and development of new lighting technologies.

## Background

The spread of LED lighting has been a great victory for energy efficiency. More progress is possible through development of a next generation of lighting technology such as laser diodes, as well as advancing the state of the art of light emitting diodes (LEDs). 

Laser diodes could be more efficient than LEDs because they don't suffer as much from the efficiency loss which happens in LEDs as the current increases. This droop results in a reduction of luminance achievable per diode [^"1"]. In order to achieve greater luminance, the physical size of the LED must also be greater, whereas laser diodes do not require such drastic increases in size for luminance [^"3"].

LED technology can also be improved. The first LEDs were limited in the range of colors they were able to produce. The use of rare earth elements has provided a way for other colors to be produced by LEDs. New advancements in material science may allow for a better range of color emission without the need for rare earth elements [^"2"]. 

## Implementation

Further research and development is needed in all lighting areas. Laser diodes must be modified so that they are capable of producing diffuse light [^"3"].
