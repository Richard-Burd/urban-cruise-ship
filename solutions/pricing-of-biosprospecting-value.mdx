## Description

We propose that national governments impose fees on development to account for the loss of bioprospecting value.

## Background

Economic incentives, such as revising and increasing normative fees for natural resource use and imposing higher fines for environmental legislation violations, have shown potential in promoting sustainability at the regional level. These fees can be based on the environmental impact of activities, acting as a deterrent to harmful practices and encouraging more sustainable alternatives[^"3"].

Conservation practices, including those funded by development fees, can contribute to sustainable tourism development, providing economic benefits to local communities[^"4"].


## Implementation

A portion of the fees should support traditional communities reliant on biodiverse ecosystems. This includes funding programs that preserve indigenous sustainable land use and conservation knowledge. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) should be used to evaluate potential biodiversity impacts of proposed projects is vital. Fees can be calibrated based on these assessments, ensuring those with greater impacts pay more[^"5"].
