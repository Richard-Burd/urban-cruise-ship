## Description
We propose capturing landfill gas (LFG) from municipal solid waste (MSW).

## Background

Globally, 2.3 billion tons of municipal solid waste were generated in 2023 [^"1"]. Landfill gas is comprised of approximately 50% methane and 50% CO₂, with trace levels of other compounds, including nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and non-methane organic compounds, such as ammonia and sulfides [^"2"]. Mitigation of LFG has health benefits by reducing these hazardous air pollutants that increase the risk of cancer, cause respiratory issues, and produce strong and unpleasant odors [^"2"].

One ton of methane causes 32 times the global warming than one ton of carbon dioxide (CO₂) over a 100 year period [^"5"]. Captured LFG can be turned into electricity, heat, or vehicle fuels [^"2"].

On average a LFG project would create 28 jobs [^"2"].

## Calculations
Assuming full implementation of current technology (and including composting and recycling mitigation), 295 million tons of CO₂e could be reduced annually [^"3"]. Valued at $50 per ton, the societal benefit is $14.8 billion annually.

Costs are estimated at $21.3 per ton CO₂e abatement [^"3"], equaling $6.3 billion annually.

## Implementation
While we advocate for a reduction in landfilling in general, with greater recycling and reuse, the practice of landfilling will not be entirely completely. The average LFG capture efficiency with current technology is around 48% [^"4"], meaning there is a large gap for improvement in the technology. Federal incentives such as tax credits and loans can be helpful in getting LFG projects started and running [^"3"].
