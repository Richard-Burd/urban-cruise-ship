## Description
We propose capturing landfill gas (LFG) from municipal solid waste (MSW).

## Background
There was 2.3 billion tons of municipal solid waste generated globally in 2023[^”1”]. The average rate of methane capture is .05 ton of methane per ton of MSW[^”2”]. This means a potential of 115 million tons of methane captured annually. One ton of methane causes 72 times more global warming than one ton of carbon dioxide (CO₂)[^”3”]. Captured LFG can be turned into electricity, heat, or vehicle fuels[^”3”].

Landfill gas is comprised of approximately 50% methane and 50% CO₂, with trace levels of other compounds, including nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) such as ammonia and sulfides[^”3”]. Mitigation of LFG also has health benefits by reducing these hazardous air pollutants that can increase the risk of cancer, cause respiratory issues, and produce strong and unpleasant odors[^”3”].

On average a LFG project would create 28 jobs[^”3”].

## Calculations
115 million tons of captured methane equals 8.3 billion tons CO₂e of global warming potential reduction. Valued at $50 per ton that is a societal benefit of $415 billion annually.

Costs are estimated at $20 per ton CO₂e abatement[^”4”], equaling $166 billion annually.

## Implementation
While we advocate for a reduction in landfilling in general, with greater recycling and reuse, the practice of landfilling will likely not be eliminated completely. The average LFG capture efficiency with current technology is around 48%[^”2”], meaning there is a large gap for improvement in the technology. Federal incentives such as tax credits and loans can be very helpful in getting LFG projects started and running[^”3”].
