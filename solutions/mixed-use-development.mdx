The need for driving and mass transit can be reduced, and the convenience to citizens enhanced, by conducting urban development more along mixed use principles. One way this could be done is for cities to relax zoning rules that keep different uses, such as housing, shopping, offices, and light industry, highly segregated.

A well-designed mixed use development insures the safety and convenience of non-motorized forms of transportation and that the retail meets the needs of nearby residents [^"2"]. Outside of an urban core, "missing middle" housing forms, such as rowhouses, duplexes, or cottage housing, may be the most appropriate [^"13"]. Mixed-use development often works best when built around major transit hubs, in which case it is termed transit-oriented development [^"14"]. The State of Oregon has developed model legislation [^"19"].

Rents tend to be higher in mixed use development than comparable alternatives, suggesting a demand for proximity to offices and retail [^"9"]. Consequently, efforts to promote mixed use development might be paired with regulatory efforts to reduce rents [^"17"]. However, we expect that with sufficient supply of mixed use development, the cost premium will disappear.
