##Description
We propose that cities relax zoning rules that keep different uses, such as housing, shopping, offices, and light industry, highly segregated, so that urban areas can be developed using mixed use principles.

## Background
Mixed use development principles can help reduce the need for driving and mass transit while enhancing the convenience for citizens.

A well-designed mixed use development insures the safety and convenience of non-motorized forms of transportation and that the retail meets the needs of nearby residents [^"2"]. Outside of an urban core, "missing middle" housing forms, such as rowhouses, duplexes, or cottage housing, may be the most appropriate [^"13"]. Mixed-use development often works best when built around major transit hubs, in which case it is termed transit-oriented development [^"14"]. The State of Oregon has developed model legislation [^"19"].

The benefits of mixed-use developments include:  
*High quality design with frequent revitalization built in[^"3"]  
*Provides more housing variety [^"3"]  
*Promotes pedestrian, bicycle, and other environmentally friendly forms of transportation[^"3"]  
*Reduces auto dependency, road congestion, and air pollution[^"3"]  
*Promotes a sense of community, place, and village-style centers, and enhances an areas unique identity[^"3"]  
*Promotes efficient use of land and infrastructure while protecting environmentally sensitive resources[^"3"]  
* Increases revenues and encourages economic investment[^"3"]

The drawbacks of mixed-use developments include an increase of noise and typically smaller housing (which can be a benefit as well) [^"4"]. It can be difficult for mixed-use proposals to get approved and they can take a long time to design, plan, and implement[^"4"]. However they are generally well worth the time investment.

## Implementation
Rents tend to be higher in mixed use development than comparable alternatives, suggesting a demand for proximity to offices and retail [^"9"]. Consequently, efforts to promote mixed use development might be paired with regulatory efforts to reduce rents [^"17"]. However, we expect that with sufficient supply of mixed use development, the cost premium will disappear.

Traffic engineers typically lack information on mixed use developments, which leads to an overestimation of traffic impacts and higher development fees[^"1"]. This can enhance opposition to these projects as well as other adverse effects such as an oversupply of parking[^"1"]. It will be essential that more research is done on mixed use development projects and that the compiled information is made available to traffic engineers and development managers to ensure that future projects are completed to their highest potential benefits.
