## Description
We propose that the U.S. Department of Agriculture create and maintain a nitrogen fertilizer reserve.

## Background
Nitrogen fertilizer comprises at least 30% of the cost of some commodity crops in the United States, and as of early 2022, the prices of nitrogen fertilizers have more than doubled since 2020 [^"11"]. High natural gas prices and export controls of fertilizer, resulting from the Russia-Ukraine War, have contributed to this price run-up [^"7"].

A nitrogen reserve would ensure a stable supply of fertilizer. This would provide a buffer against supply chain disruptions, stabilize the price, and help maintain optimal crop yields[^"1"],[^"2"].

## Implementation
While the USDA is the most likely organization to create and maintain a fertilizer reserve it would need to have private sector companies to handle the logistics, storage, and distribution.

In order to store a sufficient amount of nitrogen fertilizer to stabilize prices and provide during a crisis would require a substantial amount. This creates many barriers that would need to be addressed. There would need to be strict regulations and safety measures to mitigate any environmental impact potential, for example. There also could be significant political and public opposition to the expenditures.
