## Description

We propose that extended producer responsibility rules (EPR) be adopted for wind turbine blades.

## Background

Extended producer responsibility would require manufacturers or installers of wind turbines to recycle the blades after they are decommissioned from use. One form such rules might take are mandates to achieve a given recycling rate, where the rate increases as fast as recycling facilities can practically be scaled up [^"1"].

Possible reuses of turbine blades include powerline structures [^"7"], pedestrian bridges for greenways [^"7"], 3D printing feedstock [^"14"], and new composite materials [^"9"].

To calculate these figures, we estimate that just over 10 million tons of wind turbine blades will be decommissioned annually by 2050. This is based on a project 2.2 million tons of blades decommissioned annually in 2050 in the United States [^"2"] and that the United States comprised about 20% of worldwide wind power generation in 2022 [^"3"].

We estimate per-ton impacts of end-of-life management of turbine blades from Yang et al. [^"4"]. For both greenhouse gas reduction and financial benefit, the best option that Yang et al. assess is mechanical recycling of blades into glass fibers and fine powder, with a small unrecyclable residue landfilled. Mechanical recycling with landfilling of residue has an advantage of 0.97 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> reduced per ton of blades processed, relatively to landfilling, mostly as a result of displacing the need to manufacture new glass fibers.

Per-ton costs and benefits is based on China and derived from Yang et al. [^"4"] and again assesses mechanical recycling with landfilling of unrecyclable residue. Costs include $26/ton for transportation to recycling facilities, $11/ton for handing and shredding, $77/ton for grinding of blades, $6/ton for sorting and classification of recycled material, $14/ton for depreciation of equipment, and $16/ton for transportation of unrecyclable residue to landfills and the tipping fees for those landfills.

Benefits include $26/ton for avoided transportation to a landfill, $11/ton for avoided handling at the landfill, $23/ton for avoided landfill tipping fees, $335/ton for the value of recovered glass fibers, and $19/ton for the value of recovered filler material.

A cost of dismantling the turbines, which is common to all end-of-life options, is not included. Numbers stated here do not add exactly to numbers portrayed in the graphic above due to independent rounding. Note that the numbers presented are assessed for a scenario in China, and they would have to be adapted to find exact cost and benefit figures in other countries.

## Implementation

Wind power at a large scale is relatively new, and consequently an industry to recycle blades is not yet well-developed [^"7"]. Strategies to build a recycling industry include a government-funded competition to develop new recycling techniques [^"5"] and a ban on turbine blades in landfills [^"6"].

An EPR mandate may facilitate recycling by spurring the adoption of more recyclable blade material [^"12"].
