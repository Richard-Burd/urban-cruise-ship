## Description


We recommend industrialized nations establish food reserves to protect themselves and their allies against food supply disruptions.


## Background




Strategic food reserves have been used by governing bodies since the earliest human civilizations[^"1"], however, many food reserves have been abandoned or minimized in recent decades due to a number of factors[^"2"]
- They are expensive to maintain, complex to administer, and mismanagement can intensify problems[^"2"]
- The 1980â€™s brought about an era of decreased government intervention in markets, and it was generally accepted that the market was better equipped to handle food security needs[^"2"]
- They must balance public and private sector relationships. The private sector outstrips the power, knowledge and financing of governments, especially in developing countries[^"2"]


Recent events such as COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have driven up food insecurity around the world, highlighting the inadequacies of market forces.[^"3"] The US grain reserve operates as a cash trust, not a physical stock, and many of its food crisis programs have a six-month lag time for food to reach its destination.[^"4"]


Food reserves can increase demand in low-demand years, and help prevent food insecurity when demand is high. This helps farmers to predict markets and discourages over-production.[^"2"] [^"4"]
