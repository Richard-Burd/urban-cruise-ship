## Description


We recommend industrialized nations establish food reserves to protect themselves and their allies against food supply disruptions.


## Background


Strategic food reserves have been used by governing bodies since the earliest human civilizations [^"1"], however, many food reserves have been abandoned or minimized in recent decades due to a number of factors [^"2"]
- They are expensive to maintain, complex to administer, and mismanagement can intensify problems [^"2"]
- The 1980â€™s brought about an era of decreased government intervention in markets, and it was generally accepted that the market was better equipped to handle food security needs [^"2"]
- They must balance public and private sector relationships. The private sector outstrips the power, knowledge and financing of governments, especially in developing countries [^"2"]


Recent events such as COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have driven up food insecurity around the world, highlighting the inadequacies of market forces. [^"3"] The US grain reserve operates as a cash trust, not a physical stock, and many of its food crisis programs have a six-month lag time for food to reach its destination. [^"4"]


Unregulated markets typically create years of low or falling food prices interrupted by extreme spikes. [^"2"] Futures markets, used to reduce price volatility by allowing farmers to sell their harvests ahead of time, have shown themselves to be inadequate and to worsen a food crisis. In 2008, future markets were blamed for inflating food prices. [^"5"]  Food reserves can increase demand in the falling years, and smooth out spikes. This helps farmers to predict markets and discourages over-production. [^"2"] [^"4"]
