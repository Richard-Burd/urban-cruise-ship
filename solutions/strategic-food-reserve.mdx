## Description


We recommend industrialized nations establish food reserves to protect themselves and their allies against food supply disruptions.


## Background




Strategic food reserves have been used by governing bodies since the earliest human civilizations [^"1"]. However, many food reserves have been abandoned or minimized in recent decades [^"2"]. They are expensive to maintain, complex to administer, and mismanagement can intensify problems. The 1980s brought decreased government intervention in markets, and it was generally accepted that the market was better equipped to handle food security needs.


Recent events such as COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have driven up food insecurity around the world, highlighting the inadequacies of market forces [^"3"]. The U.S. grain reserve operates as a cash trust, rather than as a physical stock, and many of its food crisis programs have a six-month lag time for food to reach its destination [^"4"].


Food reserves can increase demand in low-demand years, and help prevent food insecurity when demand is high. This helps farmers to predict markets and discourages over-production [^"2"], [^"4"].
