## Description

We recommend a balanced approach to polycentric development to curb transportation emissions, and avoid problems caused by over-decentralization.

## Background

Polycentric development is an urban planning model that promotes the distribution of urban centers across a metropolitan area, aiming to bring workplaces and amenities closer to residential areas, thus reducing the need for long-distance commuting and, theoretically, carbon emissions from transportation. Studies on the connection between polycentric design and carbon emission have had mixed results [^"1"]. Polycentric planning must be done in the right way in order to achive emission reductions.

Evidence from studies across US metropolitan areas, identified through night-time lights, suggests that polycentric development can lead to lower transportation carbon emissions [^"1"]. However, the relationship between polycentric development and transportation carbon emissions is complex and influenced by various factors including urban planning policies, the scale of logistic activities, and the adoption of renewable energy technologies. Scenario analysis based on machine learning and deep neural network models predicts that, while polycentric development can mitigate the growth rate of carbon emissions, comprehensive strategies integrating technological innovation and systemic changes in energy consumption are crucial for sustainable transportation development [^"7"].

## Implementation

The functional aspects of polycentric development, which relate to how urban centers interact and are integrated, have a more significant impact on reducing carbon emissions than merely the distribution of these centers. It is vital to ensure that multiple centers are functionally integrated to optimize transportation efficiency and reduce emissions, instead of focusing purely on a polycentric distribution [^"5"].
