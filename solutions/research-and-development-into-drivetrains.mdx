## Description
We recommend R&D into drivetrain technologies for wind turbines. 

## Background
Wind power has advanced considerably in recent years, both in terms of market share and technology, but further development is necessary for wind to achieve its full potential. Drivetrains are one of several areas in which research is needed; others include a better understanding of atmospheric physics, aerodynamics of larger turbines, and better integration into the grid [^"54"].

The drivetrain is the power conversion system that converts the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy[^"1"]. The main challenges in drivetrain research include drivetrain dynamic responses in large or floating turbines, aerodynamic and farm control effects, use of rare-earth material in generators, improving reliability through prognostics, and use of advances in digitalization[^"1"].
Monitoring has been, and will continue to be, an important part of these efforts [^"46"].

## Implementation
In 2007, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory established the Drivetrain Reliability Collaborative to bring together government and industry to improve drivetrain lifespan and reduce wind turbine maintenance needs [^"25"]. The Gearbox Reliability Collaborative, focusing on gearboxes, was also established [^"25"]. Such efforts should continue to be fully funded.
