## Description
We cautiously recommend the expansion of orbital manufacturing with focus on reusable vehicles, lifecycle assessments, and regulations to ensure future net climate benefits.

## Background
Orbital (in-space) manufacturing exploits microgravity, hard vacuum, and extreme thermal environments to make materials and products that are difficult or impossible to produce on Earth. For example purer crystals, novel alloys, and contamination-free optical components. These environment-driven advantages can enable higher performance semiconductors, unique pharmaceutical crystal forms, and large precision structures (e.g., very low-defect optical fiber or telescope components) [^”1”].

Current projects:  
•	<b>[Varda Space Industries]( https://www.varda.com/)</b> — commercial returnable capsules for microgravity drug/crystal processing. Multiple missions launched; demonstrated retrievals and more flights in 2024–2025 with additional funding to scale operations.  
•	<b>[Space Forge]( https://www.spaceforge.com/)</b> — UK firm developing ForgeStar reusable manufacturing satellites. ForgeStar-1 recently launched as an on-orbit manufacturing demonstrator (initial activation/testing phase), with plans for returnable iterations.  
•	<b>[Redwire]( https://ir.redwirespace.com/)</b> — Comparatively long history of microgravity 3D printing and NASA-partnered in-space manufacturing R&D; Redwire continues to develop manufacturing tech and lunar/martian fabrication capabilities.  
•	<b>NASA programs</b> — [ISAM (In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing)]( https://www.nasa.gov/nexis/isam/) and [InSPA (In-Space Production Applications)]( https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/space-station-research-and-technology/in-space-production-applications/) invest in technologies, fund demonstrations, and create procurement pathways to scale commercial production in low-earth orbit (LEO) and beyond.

## Implementation
If space-made items enable more efficient tech on Earth (more efficient power electronics, better pharma formulations), lifecycle emissions could fall, however net climate benefits depend on launch/return energy accounting and production scale[^”1”],[^”2”]. Reusable capsules and modular satellite buses are critical to ensure that the cost per kilogram to/from orbit falls and becomes predictable. Careful lifecycle assessments (LCA) are required to make decisions towards ensuring future net climate benefits.

NASA, national regulators, and industry consortia will need to develop methods to certify space-manufactured products for terrestrial uses (pharma, semiconductors) and establish repeatable quality metrics and safety standards.

GAO notes increased ISAM efforts risks collisions, complicates operations, and raises insurance costs[^”3”]. Monitoring, reducing, and removing [orbital debris](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/space/ethics/orbital_debris) could go a long way to reduce collision risks and associated costs.
