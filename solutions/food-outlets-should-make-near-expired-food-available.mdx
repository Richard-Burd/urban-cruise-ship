## Description

We reccommend grocery retailers reduce food waste by promoting the sale of near-expired foods.

## Background

Grocery stores often prioritize food availablilty in order to increase customer satisfaction which contributes to overstocking[^"3"].

Messaging about food waste alone can affect consumer behavior, increasing willingness to buy near-expired food, even when there are no discounts. Consumers also engage in more waste prevention when they know they are buying nearly expired food[^"1"].


## Implementation

Clear messaging about food waste prevention can prevent food waste. Grocery stores should also take efforts to increase the visibility of near expired foods[^"3"] [^"1"].
