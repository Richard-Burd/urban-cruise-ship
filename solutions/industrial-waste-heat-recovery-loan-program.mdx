## Description
The Department of Energy Loan Programs Office [^"17"] should explore low interest loans to companies wishing to build infrastructure to recycle industrial heat.


## Background
Many firms already exist to build this infrastructure, and they offer consulting and assessment [^"5"]. In the U.S., there is enough industrial waste heat to generate 6000-8000 megawatts of electricity [^"18"], and about 557 MW are currently recycled [^"15"] in what is expected to be a 10.5 billion dollar industry [^"6"]. Following are some barriers to further recycling:
- The process is not perceived as 'green' and therefore lacks the social capital of solar & wind initiatives.
- Companies might not have room for heat recycling equipment on their premises [^"23"].
- Installing heat recycling equipment may involve a temporary halt in production, which affects productivity reporting and shareholder concerns.
- There are risks associated with installing any new equipment at a facility, and managers fear mishaps & accidents.
- Payback periods can range from 3 to 36 months [^"13"], [^"15"], while average employee tenures in the U.S. are below 5 years [^"2"]. Thus fewer individual leaders are incentivised to advocate for programs with longer paybacks [^"23"].

## Calculations
This section is under construction.

## Implementation
Loans could be structured so as to eliminate the payback period only, and not necessarily cover the total cost of the heat recycling equipment installation. Below is a diagram illustrating the optimal configuration of a loan from an incentivization perspective.
