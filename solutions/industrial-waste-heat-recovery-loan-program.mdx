## Description
The Department of Energy Loan Programs Office [^"17"] should explore low interest loans to companies wishing to build infrastructure to recycle industrial heat.


## Background
Many firms already exist to build this infrastructure, and they offer consulting and assessment [^"5"]. In the U.S., there is enough industrial waste heat to generate 6,000-8,000 megawatts of electricity [^"18"], and about 557 MW are currently recycled [^"15"] in what is expected to be a $10.5 billion industry [^"6"]. There are several barriers to further recycling.

Waste heat recycling is not perceived as 'green' and therefore lacks the social capital of solar and wind initiatives.

Manufacturers might not have room for heat recycling equipment on their premises [^"23"]. Installing heat recycling equipment may involve a temporary halt in production, which affects productivity reporting and shareholder concerns. Futhermore, any new equipment entails risks of mishaps and accidents.

Payback periods can range from 3 to 36 months [^"13"], [^"15"], while average employee tenures in the U.S. are below 5 years [^"2"]. Thus fewer individual leaders are incentivized to advocate for programs with longer paybacks [^"23"].

## Calculations
Starting with the EPA's low [conservative] estimate of 6,000 megawatts available across the U.S. [^"18"] We examine cost, benefit (savings), and COâ‚‚ reduction numbers on 10 case study projects [^"13"], [^"15"] involving heat recycling and then extrapolate their numbers onto half of the EPA's 6,000 megawatts. We project those numbers over a 10 year period at a 7% discount rate and then divide those numbers by 10 to get the annual figures shown above.

## Implementation
Loans could be structured so as to eliminate the payback period only, and not necessarily cover the total cost of the heat recycling equipment installation. Below is a diagram illustrating the optimal configuration of a loan from an incentivization perspective.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 increased the lending authority of the U.S. Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office by more than $100 billion and also created a new loan program called *The Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) Program* [^"25"]. Industrial heat recycling projects would meet the criteria of this new program but most of our policymakers still do not perceive heat recycling as 'green' enough to receive government backing so an informational advocacy campaign may be needed to change that.
