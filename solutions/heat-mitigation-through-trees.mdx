We propose that cities plant trees to mitigate the urban heat island effect and for other benefits. A study of five cities in the United States found that tree planting has a positive cost-benefit ratio in all five cases.

Evapotranspiration and shading provided by trees have been found to reduce peak summer temperatures by 1-5 °C, or 2-9 °F. [^"14"].

To maximize the value of tree planting investments, cities should identify which neighborhoods are most devoid of trees and which have the highest summertime temperatures [^"12"], as well as have disproportionately socially vulnerable residents [^"11"].
