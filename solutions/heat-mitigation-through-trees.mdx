## Description
We propose that cities around the world plant trees for heat mitigation as well as other benefits.

## Background
Evapotranspiration and shading provided by trees have been found to reduce peak summer temperatures by 1-5 °C, or 2-9 °F[^”1”].

The following benefits have also been found:
•	Reduced energy use: Trees and vegetation that directly shade buildings decrease demand for air conditioning[^”1”].
•	Improved air quality and lower greenhouse gas emissions: By reducing energy demand, trees and vegetation decrease the production of associated air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. They also remove air pollutants and store and sequester carbon dioxide[^”1”].
•	Enhanced stormwater management and water quality: Vegetation reduces runoff and improves water quality by absorbing and filtering rainwater[^”1”].
•	Reduced pavement maintenance: Tree shade can slow deterioration of street pavement, decreasing the amount of maintenance needed[^”1”].
•	Improved quality of life: Trees and vegetation provide aesthetic value, habitat for many species, and can reduce noise[^”1”].
The primary costs are: purchasing materials, initial planting, and ongoing maintenance activities[^”1”].
The following is a study of five cities in the U.S. to obtain cost and benefit metrics[^”2”].

## Calculations

By averaging the metrics in the study above we come to a cost of $39.82, and a benefit of $77.26 per tree.

There are currently 4.4 billion people living in urban areas[^”3”]. The average trees per capita in the studies above was .264[^”2”]. That would mean planting 1.16 billion trees to increase the urban trees per capita rate.

A mature tree will absorb 48 pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere[^”4”]. That equals 55.68 billion pounds or 25.26 million tons of carbon dioxide reduction.


## Implementation
To maximize the value of planting trees, city planners should identify which neighborhoods are most in need of trees where the urban heat island can be reduced the most. They can also prioritize disproportionately socially vulnerable residents[^”5”].
