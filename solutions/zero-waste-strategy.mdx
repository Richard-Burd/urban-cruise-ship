We propose a zero-waste strategy with the following planks.
- [National landfill tax](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/waste/landfill_tax), on the order of $100/ton of landfilled material. 
- [Wet/dry collection system](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/waste/waste_facilities)
- Public funding of [material recovery facilities (MRF)](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/waste/waste_facilities), to be financed through the landfill tax.

A model for the funding of MRFs is the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. The CWSRF is a revolving fund that provides below-market-rate loans for the construction of wastewater facilities [^{"u.s.EPA"}].

An outright ban on landfilling, or detailed regulation about what can and can not be placed in a landfill, may be infeasible due to the tradeoffs and complexity of such rules. Instead, we have proposed a Pigouvian tax on landfilling, which sets a balance between the benefits and costs of recycling and insures that recycling is done when and only when it is economically feasible, given external costs.

Other examples of Pigouvian taxes for environmental policy in the United States include the Ozone Depleting Chemicals Tax, which taxes ozone-depleting chemicals relative to the damage they cause, the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which taxes oil extraction to compensate those hurt by oil spills, and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, which taxes coal mining based on harm to the envionment [^{"mansur-p-2015"}]. State examples, relating to solid waste, include pay-as-you-throw schemes, which charge customers based on how much they discard; surcharges on plastic bags that often end up as litter; and bottle-deposit systems [^{"mansur-p-2015"}].
