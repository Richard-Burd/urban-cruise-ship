## Details
This is text inside the zero-waste-strategy.mdx file, there is a footnote here [^{"firstsolution"}] in the paragraph. This MDX Markdown file is being pass through, styled, and rendered by the SolutionDropdown.js component that needs to be animated.  This file is located in the ***./components*** directory, so it is not given a route by Next.js.

[^{"firstsolution"}]: This is the first footnote text

It appears that in order to use this schema, we must be OK with solution dropdown boxes having their own footnotes section, otherwise a different approach should be taken.

The image below is just a test image from another article to make sure images are rendering properly in a solution box

<ArticleImage image={"reuse.svg"} width={900} height={350} />

#### this is the smaller text used to describe images with a footnote [^{"secondsolution"}]

[^{"secondsolution"}]: This is the second footnote text
