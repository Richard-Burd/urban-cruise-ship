import SolutionDropdown from '/components/SolutionDropdown.js'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Zero Waste Strategy',
  author: 'Lee Robinson'
}

export const problem = "This solution box is under construction right now.";
export const solution = "This solution box must be developed in the future";

## Details
This is text inside the zero-waste-strategy.mdx file, there is a footnote here [^{"second"}] in the paragraph. This MDX Markdown file is being pass through, styled, and rendered by the SolutionDropdown.js component that needs to be animated.  This file is located in the ***./components*** directory, so it is not given a route by Next.js.

It appears that in order to use this schema, we must be OK with solution dropdown boxes having their own footnotes section, otherwise a different approach should be taken.

[^{"second"}]: This is the second footnote text

export default ({ children }) => <SolutionDropdown meta={meta} problem={problem} solution={solution}>{children}</SolutionDropdown>
