## Description

We reccomend walkable infrastructure and less meat consumption as methods to improve cardiovascular health.

## Background

Public health efforts should focus on reducing cardiovascular risk, the single greatest health risk. The Healthy People Initiative has, and continues to, identify tools for improving cardiovascular health, including prevention of disease, reduction of morbidity and mortality, and systems of care [^"15"].

To improve prevention, we discuss at greater length two approaches. First, exercise is critical for improve cardiovascular health, and this can be promoted through more walkable urban forms, such as a [development set design methodology](/cities/cities_mobility/development_sets) or [mixed-used development](/cities/cities_mobility/cities_pedestrian). Several studies have demonstrated an association between compact development and cardivascular health [^"8"], [^"14"], [^"19"].

Second, [less meat consumption](/matter/diet/diet_health) has been shown to improve cardiovascular health.
