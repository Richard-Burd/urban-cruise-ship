## Description
We recommend further research and development of mineral based carbon sequestration as a way to reduce greenhouse gases.

## Background
Mineral-based carbon sequestration, through enhanced weathering or mineral carbonation discussed above, is a relatively low-risk method of reducing emissions. The high energy consumption means that the process needs to be powered by a low-cost source of clean energy.

The greatest benefit of carbon mineralization is that the carbon is trapped within the mineral structure and is unable to return to the atmosphere, thus creating a long-term storage solution[^"1"]. Asbestos mine tailings can be used in the carbon mineralization process which has an added benefit of reducing the risk of asbestos exposure[^"1"].

Drawbacks to carbon mineralization from the injection method include possible negative ecosystem impacts, large water requirements, and the potential to trigger earthquakes[^"1"]. While the use of crushed mining waste rocks may cost more, it has the potential to sequester carbon quicker and the main drawback is the storage of the resulting material[^"1"]. Some of these can become valuable byproducts that can help reduce the cost, such as carbonated concrete[^"2"].

## Calculations
Currently the cost range of carbon mineralization is between $50-$100 per ton of CO2 captured[^"2"].

Technology and knowledge about mineralization is still immature, and thus the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has called for about $1 billion to be spent over 10-20 years to conduct research into the technology [^"8"]. Pilot projects of mineralization have been conducted, such as the 10,000 ton CO<sub>2</sub> Carbfix mineralization project in Iceland [^"4"].

## Implementation
As mineralization gains commercial viability, it will need to be supported through government spending. The 45Q provisions, designed to support carbon capture and sequestration, are a good model [^"6"]. While 45Q may apply to mineralization, explicit support for mineralization, as well as a timeframe extending beyond the 2026 deadline for construction a facility under 45Q, will be helpful.
