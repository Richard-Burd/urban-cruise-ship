Mineral-based carbon sequestestration, whether through enhanced weathering or mineral carbonation discussed above, is a relatively low-risk method of reducing emissions. The high energy consumption means that the process needs to be powered by a low-cost source of clean energy.

Technology and knowledge about mineralization is still immature, and thus the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has called for about $1 billion to be spent over 10-20 years to conduct research into the technology [^"8"]. Pilot projects of mineralization have been conducted, such as the 10,000 ton CO<sub>2</sub> Carbfix mineralization project in Iceland [^"4"].

As mineralization gains commercial viability, it will need to be supported through government spending. The 45Q provisions, designed to support carbon capture and sequestration, are a good model [^"6"]. While 45Q may apply to mineralization, explicit support for mineralization, as well as a timeframe extending beyond the 2026 deadline for construction a facility under 45Q, will be helpful.
