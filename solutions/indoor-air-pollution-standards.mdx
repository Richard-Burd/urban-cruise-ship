## Description

We recommend the United States, European Union, and United Kingdom adopt indoor building material standards to improve indoor air quality.

## Background

People are indoors 87% of the time. Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is thus vital in ensuring better health.[^"1"] Some of the main cause of causes of detrimental air quality are:
- Construction materials[^"1"]
- Furniture[^"1"]
- Paint[^"1"]
- Ventilation ducts[^"1"]
- Cleaning products[^"3"]
- Heating and cooking appliances[^"3"]
- Formaldehyde (derives from construction materials and furniture)[^"3"]

This is typically combated by higher ventilation or air purification systems[^"3"], but by choosing materials in the home that are less polluting, less ventilation is required.[^"1"]

Finland uses a classification system for building materials to address indoor air quality. In response, companies have developed low-emitting materials, furniture, and HVAC equipment to meet these standards. [^"2"]

## Implementation

The EPA could create regulations establishing indoor air regulations that account for indoor contaminant sources. [^"4"] Such regulations could include a classification system for building materials that could affect indoor air quality[^"6"], and craft a classification system similar to what has succeeded in Finland. The implementation could involve private sector partnerships which have attempted to address indoor air pollution with private certifications.[^"5"]
