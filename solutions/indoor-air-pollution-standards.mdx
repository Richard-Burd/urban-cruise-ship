## Description
We recommend the United States, European Union, and United Kingdom adopt indoor building material standards to improve indoor air quality.

## Background
Indoor air quality in the U.S., E.U., and U.K. is a growing concern due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde, and particulate matter released from common building materials. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that poor indoor air quality contributes to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and cognitive decline[^"7"].
People are indoors 87% of the time. Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is thus vital in ensuring better health.[^"1"] Some of the main cause of causes of detrimental air quality are:  
- Pressed wood products emitting formaldehyde[^"1"],[^"3"]  
- Paint, adhesives, and finishes emitting VOCs[^"1"]  
- Ventilation ducts and insulation materials[^"1"]  
- Cleaning products[^"3"]  
- Heating and cooking appliances[^"3"]
The chemicals released from these products can cause respiratory issues, neurological effects and carry cancer risks[^"8"]. This is typically combated by higher ventilation or air purification systems[^"3"], but by choosing materials in the home that are less polluting, less ventilation is required.[^"1"]
Finland has stringent indoor air quality standards that include an emissions classification system, mandatory air quality assessments and encourages the use of natural low-emission materials[^"9"]. In response, companies have developed low-emitting materials, furniture, and HVAC equipment to meet these standards[^"2"]. As a result, Finland has reported reduced cases of indoor air-related illnesses and improved workplace productivity[^"9"].

## Calculations
Government agencies would require funds for monitoring, enforcement, and public outreach.
Retrofitting production lines for low-emission materials would be a major cost for building industries. 
Reduced respiratory illnesses would lead to savings in healthcare costs.
Encouraging investment in low-emission materials could create new market opportunities.
Better IAQ could lead to a 5-10% productivity increase in workplaces[^"10"].

## Implementation
In the U.S., the [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]( https://www.epa.gov/) and [Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)]( https://www.hud.gov/) would need to introduce new regulations under the Clean Air Act or other housing codes.
In the E.U., the [European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)]( https://echa.europa.eu/) could amend REACH regulations to include stricter indoor material emissions limits.
In the U.K., the [British Standards Institution (BSI)]( https://www.bsigroup.com/en-US/) could update existing indoor air quality guidelines post-Brexit.
The EPA could create regulations establishing indoor air regulations that account for indoor contaminant sources. [^"4"] Such regulations could include a classification system for building materials that could affect indoor air quality[^"6"], and craft a classification system similar to what has succeeded in Finland. The implementation could involve private sector partnerships which have attempted to address indoor air pollution with private certifications.[^"5"]
