## Background

Electric motor systems use 12,100 TWh (53% of global electricity demand) and 6,000 Megatons CO<sub>2</sub>eq emissions per year  [^"3"].Motor system efficiency improvements will help reduce emissions by reducing energy demand [^"3"]. New motor technology possesses much higher efficiencies than traditional induction motors [^"3"].


## Implementation

Inefficient electric motor systems remain in operation in many cases due to their long life, at times exceeding 20 years. This remains an obstacle to upgrades to more efficient systems  [^"3"].

Policies to increase the use of more efficient motors include raising Minimum Energy Performance Standards, financial incentives, energy audit programs, and awareness and information campaigns.

In addition to replacing inefficient motors, other measures should be examined to reduce oversizing, implementing advanced sensors, and equipping motors with variable speed/torque control where appropriate [^"3"].
