## Description

We recommend that the United States adopt a categorical exclusion for geothermal permitting on public lands.

## Background

Much of the most promising enhanced geothermal resource in the United States is on publicly owned land in the Western states, which is administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Under the National Environmental Policy Act, extensive environmental reviews are required for activities on public lands that might have an environmental impact, such as exploration and production of geothermal wells [^"2"]. These reviews can take seven to ten years [^"8"].

By contrast, oil and gas projects on federal land, due to their similarity and frequency, typically undergo expedited NEPA review and have dedicated staff at the Bureau of Land Management who are familiar with the details of oil and gas drilling and are able to process permits efficiently, a treatment known as a categorical exclusion [^"3"]. In many ways, enhanced geothermal projects are similar to oil and gas, but they have greatly reduced environmental cost [^"14"].

Expediting permits could more than double the American geothermal capacity by 2050 [^"15"].



## Calculations

Based on the U.S. Department of Energy's 2019 *GeoVision* report [^"10"], we estimate that the United States could add nearly 7 gigawatts of enhanced geothermal energy more than what would be added without any permitting reform, which would be added over the course of 32 years. We model that the amount of additional EGS electricity on the grid will grow linearly every year for 32 years, until it reaches 6.6 GW of additional electricity, after which the amount remains constant indefinitely. We convert the additional capacity into additional production with a capacity factor of 90% [^"11"].

We value the additional geothermal electicity at 7¢ per kilowatt-hour, as indicated above. The costs of our policy--environmental harm that might be inflicted as a result of the categorical exclusion--are taken to be 1.25¢/kWh [^"12"], which includes a $140 social cost of carbon and lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of enhanced geothermal at 32 grams CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh [^"13"].

To assess greenhouse gas reduction potential, we model that the additional EGS power would displace electricity in the United States at the average carbon intensity in 2022 of 376 g/kWh [^"16"].

A 7% discount rate is used throughout.

There are several uncertainties in our analysis. Costs and benefits of additional EGS deployment simply consider the value and damages of the EGS power, without assessing what other sources the EGS might displace. Greenhouse gas reduction estimates assume that the additional EGS will displace other sources at a one-for-one rate, and that the carbon intensity of electricity remains constant in the future; in reality, limitations in these assumptions may cause the GHG reduction figure to be overestimated.



## Implementation

In April 2024, the Bureau of Land Management introduced a categorical exclusion for geothermal exploration [^"1"]. This is an important step, and it should be followed by a categorical exclusion for geothermal production, as well as Congressional legislation to make the changes permanent. While the 2024 geothermal categorical exclusion is administrative, the oil and gas exclusion is statutory [^"9"].

Several such Congressional [^"4"] legislative efforts are in the works, including the Geothermal Energy Optimization Act of 2024 [^"5"] and a more limited House bill [^"6"]. Several measures have been taken or are under consideration at state legislatures and in Europe [^"7"].

Categorical exclusions to NEPA are controversial, and it is feared that their expansion, even for an environmentally beneficial purpose, could undermine the protections that NEPA is intended to bring [^"17"]. Conversely, over-reliance on categorical exclusions creates a risk that regulatory treatment of an activity depends too much on its political charisma, rather than on objective criteria.
