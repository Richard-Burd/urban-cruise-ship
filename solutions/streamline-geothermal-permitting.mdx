## Description

We reccomend the United states reform the geothermal permitting process for efficiency.

## Background

Permitting barriers are a major reason why geothermal energy has failed to gain the traction that wind or solar has gained. Oil and gas projects on federal land, due to their similarity and frequency, typically undergo expedited NEPA review and have dedicated staff at the Bureau of Land Management who are familiar with the details of oil and gas drilling and are able to process permits efficiently. There is no good reason for similar procedures to not be in place for enhanced geothermal, which is similar to oil and gas drilling but comes with greatly reduced environmental cost [^"14"].

Expediting permits could double the American geothermal capacity by 2050 [^"15"].
