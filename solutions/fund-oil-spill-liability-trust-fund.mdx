## Description

We propose that the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) excise tax be kept in place.

## Background 

The OSLTF is an important tool to ensure that oil spill cleanup costs are financed when the responsible operators are not able to do so. However, the oil production excise tax, which is the primary source of revenue for the OSLTF, has been extended intermittently [^"1"]. As of 2024, a fee of 9¢ per barrel of shipped oil is assessed for the OSLTF [^"10"].

The fund has succeeded over the last 40 years, always being capable of responding to oil spills [^"2"]. Oil well spills are limited to $1 billion spent on any one incident [^"2"], together with $500 million for natural resource damages [^"9"]. Only in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil well spill did the OSLTF reach its limit; then Congress appropriated special funds.

## Calculations

In 2010, a report from Resources for the Future [^"4"] estimated that oil spills cost $16 per gallon to clean up and an additional $2 per gallon for the monetary value of lost oil, a value which is almost $26 per gallon in 2024 dollars. Etkin [^"5"] estimates that just over 15 million gallons were spilled per year from 1980 to 2000. As of 2023, the United States consumed 7.3 billion barrels of oil per year [^"6"]. These figures suggest that private and public clean-up costs are about 5¢ per barrel.

We note some uncertainties in these figures. As the RFF report [^"4"] notes, clean-up costs vary widely across events, with the Exxon Valdez spill costing Exxon $630 (2010 dollars) per gallon, and environmental costs potentially significantly higher. Thus a higher fee than 5¢ per barrel may be appropriate to account for kurtosis risk. On the other hand, we note a generally declining trend of oil spill volumes over time [^"7"],[^"8"], which may hold in the United States.

The annual allowance for the U.S Coast Guard for operation, maintenance, and processing of claims is $25 million[^"11"].

The average disbursements for pollution incidents (from 2020 and 2021) was $13.3 million[^"12"].
The tax generates on average $500 million annually[^"3"].


## Implementation
The U.S. Coast Guard should continue to monitor and process oil spill claims and manage the fund.
Congress could expand the tax to  cover oil-sands-derived crude oils [^"3"].
