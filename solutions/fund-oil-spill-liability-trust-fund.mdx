## Description

 We propose that the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) excise tax be kept in place.

## Background 

The OSLTF is an important tool to ensure that oil spill cleanup costs are financed when the responsible operators are not able to do so. However, the oil production excise tax, which is the primary source of revenue for the OSLTF, has been extended intermittently.[^"1"] 

The fund has succeeded over the last 40 years, always being capable of responding to oil spills.[^"2"] The only time when the fund encountered limits was in 2010 during the Deepwater Horizon oil well spill, when Congress passed a provision to free up funds. Oil well spills are limited to $1 billion spent on any one incident.[^"2"]


## Implementation

Congress could expand the tax to  cover oil-sands-derived crude oils.[^"3"]
