## Description

We propose investment into hydrogen direct reduction steel production, or "green" steel, where the hydrogen is sourced from electrolysis from low-carbon electricity sources.

## Background

Steel is one of the most widely produced and essential industrial commodities, at just under 1.9 billion tons of production in 2023 [^"1"]. Steel is responsible for about 7% of world greenhouse gas emissions [^"3"]. Almost all steel today is produced through two process: the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace route for virgin steel, and the electric arc furnace for recycling of steel scrap [^"12"].

Steel production requires removing the oxygen in iron ore, a process generally performed with carbon. In the BF-BOF process, as with the Bessemer process before, a material known as coke is used both as a heat source and as the reducing agent. As the reduction process produces carbon dioxide, emissions are inherent to BF-BOF. The use of hydrogen, rather than carbon, avoids these inherent emissions.

"Green" steel is generally defined by three properties. Hydrogen is the reducing agent; the hydrogen is produced from electrolysis; and the electricity in turn is powered by low-carbon electricity. If the first criterion is met, we use the term "hydrogen direct reduction".

As defined above, green steel is not the only pathway to decarbonizing steel production. We discuss molten oxide electrolysis, or electrowinnowing, below, and we mentioned carbon capture above. However, green steel strikes a balance between deep potential emissions reductions and near-term plausibility.

## Calculations

As our estimated costs and benefits are close, the estimated cost-effectiveness of investment in hydrogen direct reduction is highly sensitive to assumptions. As of 2023, world steel production was just under 1.9 billion tons [^"1"], of which 72% was produced through BF-BOF and the remaining 28% through EAF [^"3"]. Hydrogen direct reduction is applicable to virgin steel production, and so we model that hydrogen DR will replace BF-BOF production and that electric arc furnace production will remain unaffected.

Recent BF-BOF steel prices have varied considerably due to commodity price fluctuation. A cost of $400-500 per ton has been estimated for recent BF-BOF steel [^"4"]; we use a value of $450/ton for these calculations, discounting elevated costs in 2021 that followed widespread supply chain disruptions. Estimates of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions vary and include an estimate of 2.1 tons CO<sub>2</sub> per ton of steel [^"5"]. We use a value of 1.8 tons CO<sub>2</sub>/ton of steel as per Bhaskar et al. [^"7"].

It is especially difficult to predict future hydrogen DR steel prices, as there is currently very limited production in the world beyond the pilot phase [^"9"]. For our calculations, we use a value of $672 per ton (range of $622-722 per ton) [^"7"]. We estimate lifecycle emissions for hydrogen DR steel to be 0.2 tons per ton of steel [^"8"].

In all cases, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are valued at just over $140 per ton.

## Implementation

Hydrogen direct reduction steel is not necessarily a low-carbon process if the hydrogen production is not low-carbon [^"2"]. Hydrogen direct reduction steel, where the hydrogen is produced from steam methane reforming that is unabated by carbon capture, has lifecycle emissions of about 1.3 tons CO<sub>2</sub> per ton of steel [^"7"],[^"10"], compared to 1.8 tons for today's common BF-BOF process.

About two-thirds to three-fourths of green steel costs are estimated to be operational costs, with most of that the costs of electricity and iron ore [^"7"]. For green steel to be economically viable depends on the materialization of expected cost reductions in renewable energy, particularly wind and solar power, and in hydrogen electrolyzers [^"11"].

A credible, economy-wide [carbon price](energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) is the most plausible pathway to widespread investment in green steel.
