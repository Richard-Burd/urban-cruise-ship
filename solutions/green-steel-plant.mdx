## Background

Green steel can have several meanings, but often refers to steel that is produced with hydrogen, produced by clean energy electrolysis, rather than coal as most steel is produced today. Green steel is generally too expensive to produce widely today, except where electricity is cheap and low-carbon. The price of green steel is likely to fall in coming years relative to alternatives [^"6"].

## Implementation

A study of a green steel plant in Sweden reveals that, under certain circumstances, total emmissions remain mostly unaffected. This is due to the increased need for energy in the production which may be provided by fossil fuels. Consideration for the source of energy must be taken into account[^"2"].
