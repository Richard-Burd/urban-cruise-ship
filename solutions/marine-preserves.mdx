## Description
We recommend that international organizations, national governments, and other stakeholders expand marine protected areas (MPAs) to at least 30% of the ocean surface area as proposed by The United Nation’s Fifteenth Session of the Conference of Parties (COP15)  [^"1"]


## Background:
Covering 30% of the oceans in MPAs, would entail an expansion of 78 million km² [^"3"] This will preserve species and yield economic benefits [^"5"].


Benefits include
- Increases to fisheries outside of MPAs (spillover effect) [^"8"]
- Carbon storage in mangroves, seagrasses, and kelp [^"5"]
- Safer habitats for species under threat by climate change [^"4"]
- Recreational opportunities (swimming, snorkeling, diving) [^"4"]
- Aesthetic enjoyment [^"4"]
- Job creation [^"4"]
- Preservation of cultural values [^"4"]
- Food security, nutrition [^"4"]
- Reduced infrastructure loss (bridges, roads, water, sanitation, buildings) [^"4"]
- Increased species diversity [^"8"]
- Increased survival rates of juvenile fish [^"8"]

Current MPAs have been evaluated as follows:
- Vanuatu in the South Pacific: 4.1 benefit/cost ratio [11][^"11"]
- St Martin Natural Reserve: 2.1 benefit/cost ratio [11] [^"11"]
- Cabo Pulmo National Park generates approximately 5.6 million dollars USD per year [^"12"]
- The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park generates approximately 6.4 billion USD per year [^"13"].

Ecosystem services (ES) include food, fuel, fiber, medicine, fishing, hunting, climate regulation, carbon sequestration, water purification, pest control, and protection from storm surges and erosion. [^"8"]


Opportunity costs, primarily estimates of lost revenue due to decreased fishing, comprise the largest portion of overall costs. However, in the long term, fisheries will see increased production due to the reduction of overfishing. Protection may result in initial losses but will ensure sustainability in the long term. [^"4"]

## Implementation
The benefits of marine protected areas (MPAs) are conditional on targeted selection, effective management, and enforcement. This research assumes a highly protective preservation-based approach [^"8"]. Political pressures can drive MPAs into low-use areas, limiting their effectiveness against biodiversity loss. [^"15"] Areas rich in biodiversity have been and are being identified around the world. [^"17"] The success of MPAs also depends on the inclusion of local communities, indigenous people, and other stakeholders in the decision-making process. Failure to involve these groups can lead to negative impacts and the appropriation of marine resources by outside interests. [^"9"] [^"10"] Protecting 30% of the oceans can yield annual benefits between $900 billion and $1.7 trillion.[^"8"]

Local communities can establish MPAs, and MPA networks can be an effective solution to ensure proper management and resources. International cooperation is necessary in the establishment of MPAs in international waters. In 2016, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) gained the consensus of over two dozen states to establish the world’s largest MPA in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. [^"14"]
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides a framework for cooperation. [^"6"] Regional fisheries management organizations can establish MPAs within their jurisdiction. [^"7"]

The Great Barrier Reef is regarded as an effective MPA due to its governance, legislative framework, integration with relevant government agencies, and ecosystem-based management. It could serve as an example for future MPAs. [^"16"]

We recommend additional economic valuations of the costs and benefits of MPAs, as ascertained by independent research organizations. Further data could help accelerate the implementation of MPA expansion.
