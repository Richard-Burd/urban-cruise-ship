## Description

We propose a separate collection stream for decomposable (wet) organic waste as the solution that best optimizes participation rates, collection costs, and contamination rates.

## Background


The EU produces 75 million tons of organic waste, and global production amounts to 1.3 billion tons per year [^"3"]. Compared to other types of waste, organic waste has a high global warming potential due to its release of methane [^"3"].
Separation of organic waste has been mandatory in Germany since 2015 [^"2"]. Organic waste is primarily used in agriculture as fertilizer, and in 2020, over 10 million tons of organic waste were collected [^"8"]. Efficient global food waste management could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 518 million tons [^"4"].

Studies in Denmark have showed increased material recovery, and reduced emissions from multistream recycling [^"1"]. A study in France revealed that diverting organic waste from landfills and composting it instead would reduce global warming impacts by 19%. The compost produced in this way can provide an alternative to fertilizers, resulting in reduced eutrophication risks and decreased marine ecotoxicity [^"6"].



## Implementation

Communities should implement organic waste collection programs in accordance with the needs of their jurisdictions. It is important to begin by assessing the current waste streams, and determining which collection approach is most feasible. It is also recommended to conduct pilot programs that can then follow a phasing-in approach to gradually increase organic waste collection [^"5"]. 

One innovative approach to converting organic waste into useful products is the use of fly larvae, which are capable of converting organic waste faster than anaerobic digestion. Used as a composting agent, the larvae can produce animal feed and fertilizer [^"7"].
