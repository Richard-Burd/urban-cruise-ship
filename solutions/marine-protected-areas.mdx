## Description

We recommend that international organizations, national governments, and other stakeholders expand marine protected areas (MPAs) to at least 30% of the ocean surface area as proposed by the United Nation's Fifteenth Session of the Conference of Parties (COP15) of the Biodiversity Conference [^"1"].

#### Costs and estimates are assessed at a 3% discount rate, pased on the P2P30 scenario of Brander at al. [^"8"]. Carbon sequestration estimations based upon a shadow carbon cost of $50 per ton. Estimated benefits range from $900 billion to $1.7 trillion.




## Background:
Covering 30% of the oceans in MPAs, would entail an expansion of 78 million km² [^"3"]. Benefits include enhancement to fisheries outside the MPAs and increased biodiversity and fish survival [^"8"], safer habitats [^"11"], and carbon sequestration [^"11"].

Estimates of the value of current MPAs include a 4.1 benefit/cost ratio for MPAs in Vanuatu and a 2.1 ratio at the St. Martin Natural Reserve [^"11"]. The Cabo Pulmo National Park generates about $5.6 million per year [^"12"], while the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park generates $6.4 billion per year [^"13"].

#### Ecosystem services in our benefit estimate include include food, fuel, fiber, medicine, fishing, hunting, climate regulation, carbon sequestration, water purification, pest control, and protection from storm surges and erosion [^"8"].

Opportunity costs, primarily estimates of lost revenue due to decreased fishing, comprise the largest portion of overall costs. However, in the long term, fisheries will see increased production due to the reduction of overfishing. Protection may result in initial losses but will ensure sustainability in the long term [^"11"].

## Implementation
The benefits of marine protected areas (MPAs) are conditional on targeted selection, effective management, and enforcement. This research assumes a highly protective preservation-based approach [^"8"]. Political pressures can drive MPAs into low-use areas, limiting their effectiveness against biodiversity loss [^"15"]. Areas rich in biodiversity have been and are being identified around the world [^"17"]. The success of MPAs also depends on the inclusion of local communities, indigenous people, and other stakeholders in the decision-making process. Failure to involve these groups can lead to negative impacts and the appropriation of marine resources by outside interests [^"9"], [^"10"].

Local communities can establish MPAs, and MPA networks can be an effective solution to ensure proper management and resources. International cooperation is necessary for the establishment of MPAs in international waters. In 2016, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) gained the consensus of over two dozen states to establish the world’s largest MPA in the Ross Sea, Antarctica [^"14"].
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides a framework for cooperation [^"6"]. Regional fisheries management organizations can establish MPAs within their jurisdiction [^"7"].

The Great Barrier Reef is regarded as an effective MPA due to its governance, legislative framework, integration with relevant government agencies, and ecosystem-based management. It could serve as an example for future MPAs [^"16"].

We recommend additional economic valuations of the costs and benefits of MPAs, as ascertained by independent research organizations. Further data could help accelerate the implementation of MPA expansion.
