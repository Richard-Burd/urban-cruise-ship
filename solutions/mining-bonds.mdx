## Description
Mine operators are required to post bonds for eventual reclamation of the site, but this requirement is not generally adequate [^"1"]. We propose that bonds be increased or restructured to reflect the expected cost of cleanup.

## Background
Abandoned mines sites pose a variety of environmental hazards and safety risks such as heavy metal contamination, acid drainage, and falling[^”2”].


## Calculations
In the U.S. the BLM caps bond amounts at $1,000 per acre for exploration projects, and $2,000 per acre for development[^”2”].


## Implementation
Transaction costs increase as uncertainty increases or as contracting becomes more complex, as complex contracts are costly to write, interpret, and enforce[^”2”].

An effective bonding system must be conditioned on fair and enforceable nationwide reclamation standards, stimulate companies to conduct reclamation by forming economic incentives rather than penalties that become a liability, and allow for full public participation[^”3”].

Periodic review and recalculation of the bonds is needed as the initial funds may become insufficient to complete reclamation[^”3”].
