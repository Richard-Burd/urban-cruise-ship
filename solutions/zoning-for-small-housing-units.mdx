## Description

Insofar as cities regulate housing unit size through zoning, they should allow for greater numbers of smaller units to meet unmet market demand.

## Background

The housing market has not adjusted to the global increase in people who live alone. In the United States, single-persons represent at least 40% of all households, and the trend is seen internationally. Many new housing units are designed for nuclear families, and no longer meet the requirements of today's demographics[^"6"].

## Implementation

Local governments should consider relaxing zoning laws to allow for the construction of microunit developments in areas previously zoned exclusively for single-family homes or larger apartment buildings. This adjustment could include reducing minimum lot sizes and easing restrictions on density[^"6"].

To encourage the development of microunits, cities can streamline the approval process for these projects, reducing the time and cost associated with bringing new units to market.
