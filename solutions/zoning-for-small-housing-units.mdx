## Description

Insofar as cities regulate housing unit size through zoning, they should allow for greater numbers of smaller units to meet unmet market demand.

## Background
The housing market has not adjusted to the global increase in people who live alone. In the United States, single-persons represent at least 40% of all households, and the trend is seen internationally. Many new housing units are designed for nuclear families, and no longer meet the requirements of today's demographics [^"6"].

Because of this, the global housing market is facing an acute supply-demand imbalance, particularly in urban areas. By 2030, 60% of the world’s population will live in cities, up from 56% in 2021, placing increased pressure on urban housing markets [^"7"]. In the U.S., there is a national housing shortfall of 3.8 million units, up from 2.5 million in 2018, driven by decades of underbuilding and restrictive zoning laws [^"8"].

Zoning laws in many cities restrict the construction of small or multi-family housing units by mandating large lot sizes, single-family dwellings, or density limits. Reforming these laws will allow more flexible housing development, such as duplexes, triplexes, accessory dwelling units (ADUs), and micro-apartments. Cities can then better accommodate the needs of smaller households, younger populations, and low- to moderate-income residents.

## Calculations
Minneapolis, a city of 425,000, spent $750,000 a year on public outreach, legal review, and plan adoption around eliminated single-family-only zoning citywide and promoting multi-unit housing projects [^"9"]. Applying this cost to 280 million people living in urban areas in the United States [^"10"] yields an annual cost of $496 million for similar nationwide policies.

Hsieh and Moretti [^"11"] estimate that zoning deregulation could lower housing prices by up to 50% in highly constrained metro areas, which could result in an overall increase in U.S. GDP by 3.7%. In 2023 the U.S. real GDP was $22.67 trillion [^"12"], meaning a benefit to the U.S. GDP of $839 billion annually is possible.

## Implementation

Local governments should consider relaxing zoning laws to allow for the construction of microunit developments in areas previously zoned exclusively for single-family homes or larger apartment buildings. This could include local zoning planning commissions and zoning boards, though legislation could be passed at the state level that would further streamline the process. This adjustment could include reducing minimum lot sizes and easing restrictions on density [^"6"]. To encourage the development of microunits, cities can streamline the approval process for these projects, reducing the time and cost associated with bringing new units to market.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development offers [Community Development Block Grants](https://www.hud.gov/hud-partners/community-cdbg) that could be adapted to support zoning reforms.
