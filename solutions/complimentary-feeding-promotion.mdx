## Description

To address the urgent need for improved child nutrition and health outcomes, we advocate for the United Nations, local governments, international organizations, and other stakeholders to scale up the Complementary Feeding Promotion for children aged 6–23 months, especially in low and lower-middle-income countries.

## Background

Malnutrition remains a pervasive challenge affecting millions of children worldwide, significantly in low to lower-middle-income countries. The critical period for a child's growth and development is within the first 1000 days of life, highlighting the importance of adequate nutrition [^"1"]. After 2 years of age, the effects of malnutrition can be irreversible [^"3"]. 

Complementary Feeding Promotion (CFP) involves educating caregivers on the importance of providing nutrient-rich foods in addition to breast milk from the age of 6 months. This educational program includes a cash transfer for lower-income populations who may not be able to afford nutritious food [^"1"]. Education on this topic can improve childhood health outcomes [^"1"], and participants on similar programs reported that they gained valuable knowledge [^"2"]. 

## Implementation

Strides have already been made with prenatal supplementation, and existing infrastructure should assist in the deployment of this program.
