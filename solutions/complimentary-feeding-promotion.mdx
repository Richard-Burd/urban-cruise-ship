## Description

To address the urgent need for improved child nutrition and health outcomes, we advocate for the United Nations, local governments, international organizations, and other stakeholders to scale up the Complementary Feeding Promotion for children aged 6–23 months in low- and lower-middle-income countries.

#### Benefits estimated using a 8% discount rate [^"1"]

## Background

Malnutrition remains a pervasive challenge affecting millions of children worldwide, significantly in low- to lower-middle-income countries. The critical period for a child's growth and development is within the first 1000 days of life, highlighting the importance of adequate nutrition [^"1"]. After 2 years of age, the effects of malnutrition can be irreversible [^"3"].

Complementary Feeding Promotion (CFP) involves educating caregivers on the importance of providing nutrient-rich foods in addition to breast milk from the age of 6 months. This educational program includes a cash transfer for lower-income populations who may not be able to afford nutritious food [^"1"]. Education on this topic can improve childhood health outcomes [^"1"], and participants on similar programs reported that they gained valuable knowledge [^"2"].

## Calculations

Benefits are calcuated in terms of reduced mortality and stunting risk. In this study, CFP is expected to prevent 5.9 million cases of stunting, as well as 68,123 deaths [^"1"].

Averted stunting is valued as a 30% increase in lifetime income. Averted mortality is valued using the value of statistical life at 1.55 times the respective GDP per capita of the target countries with this multiplier rising to 2.9 times per capita in 2090 [^"1"].

Costs include the cost of the program itself, the time spent by mothers and caregivers on the education sessions, and the private cost of the additional food over the 18 month span. 24 million children are expected to be in the target group. The total cost of the promotion is expected to be $61.50 per child for children in the lowest income target group, and $18.50 per child for the highest income groups [^"1"].

## Implementation

Strides have already been made with prenatal supplementation, and existing infrastructure should assist in the deployment of this program.
