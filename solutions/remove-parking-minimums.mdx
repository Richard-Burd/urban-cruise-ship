## Description

We propose that cities eliminate parking minimum requirements.


## Background

As discussed above, parking is expensive in terms of the both parking structures and the opportunity cost of land. This is especially true in urban areas where land prices are at a premium. Additionally, a parking space adds an estimated 12.5% to the cost of an affordable housing unit, and two spaces add 25% [^"25"].

Parking minimums have been found to be binding in Los Angeles [^"10"], Buffalo, New York [^"22"], and Seattle [^"12"], meaning that developers provide much more parking under the rules than they would otherwise.

## Calculations

The repeal of the parking minimum in Seattle led to developers providing 40% less parking, at a savings of 18,000 spaces and $537 million [^"12"]. Our calculations are based on applying the Seattle ordinance nationwide. The Seattle ordinance focused on parking minimums around heavily commercial districts and near transit stops, the highest value areas for eliminating parking minimums. The full potential of this policy is greater than estimated here, though the marginal benefit may be less, and political difficulty greater, than what has already been done.

We estimate that eliminating parking minimums would be applicable to half of the United States, and of those areas for which it is applicable, in half it would be feasible and has not already been done. At the rate of reduced parking found by the Seattle study, that yields just over two million fewer parking spaces.

A typical parking space is about 30 square meters when accounting for the driveway area [^"1"],[^"3"]. Thus about 220,000 people could be housed with the parking area saved with duplexes, accounting for residential and commercial needs. If this new housing in turn displaces median lot size single family homes elsewhere in the city, then 139 square kilometers of land would be saved.

Using an elasticity of 0.06 (0.06% gain of per capita GDP for 1% gain of population in a city), the agglomeration benefit of reducing parking minimums is estimated at $929 million per year.

We estimate the following:
- the average person living in a single family zone drives 28.8 miles per day [^"9"]
- 60% of such persons drive. 
- the average car has an economy of 24.4 miles per gallon [^"7"] 
- a gallon of gasoline emits 8,887 grams of CO₂ upon combustion [^"11"]
- the average driver would reduce driving by a small amount due to shorter distances between destinations, which would save 1900 tons of CO₂ emissions per year which is valued at $94 thousand if CO₂ is priced at $50/ton.


Assume no action is taken to mitigate congestion, we estimate that the increased density will result is $44 million per year of congestion costs. This estimate is based on a total traffic congestion cost of $87 billion per year in the United States [^"2"] and the hypothesis that congestion costs scale linearly with traffic density (traffic volume divided by road area).


## Implementation

Many cities throughout the United States and Canada have relaxed parking minimum rules [^"21"]. The main purpose of these rules is that, absent sufficient off-street parking, motorists will cruise for an on-street parking spot, creating a congestion externality [^"5"]. However, this problem can also be dealt with by cities not providing free on-street parking [^"19"].
