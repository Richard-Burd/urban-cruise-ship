## Description
We recommend pharmaceutical and medical companies transition to Recombinant factor C (rFC) testing to remove the need for horseshoe crab blood harvesting.

## Background
Horseshoe crab blood is currently harvested for the production of Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL), which is used to test for bacterial endotoxins in medical devices, vaccines, and pharmaceutical products. The process involves capturing and bleeding live horseshoe crabs before releasing them back into the wild.
The Atlantic horseshoe crab has been identified as a keystone species that has survived an estimated 200 million years. They are an important source of food for shorebirds, sand shrimp, fish, and crabs. They are also important predators for benthic invertebrates, and their shells provide a home for a variety of species[^"1"].
Horseshoe crab blood possesses a distinctive ability in that it will react visibly to endotoxins. This has created a demand within the medical industry for testing drugs and medical devices for safety. The blood is used with quality assurance testing[^"1"]. Since the blood is a finite biological resource this reliance on it creates supply chain vulnerabilities that could be negated by using a synthetic alternative.
Obtaining the blood requires harvesting, bleeding, and returning the crabs. Mortality rates after harvesting range from 10 to 30%. It is unknown what the exact leading cause of death is, but the stress from removing crabs from the water may be a cause, as the crab breaths through gills. This and a sudden decrease in blood supply shock their systems[^"1"]. With over 600,000 of these crabs being harvested each year, the effect on their population is significant[^"2"],[^"5"]. The practice also raises ethical concerns regarding animal welfare. In the United States the harvesting of horseshoe crabs is regulated, however other countries are loosely or not regulated at all and do not have reliable harvesting data[^"5"].
Recombinant factor C (rFC) provides a synthetic alternative to the crab blood[^"4"]. rFC tests are effective, and potentially superior to traditional testing[^"3"]. Using a synthetic alternative would create a more consistent and scalable production, increase reliability and efficiency of endotoxin testing, and lead to cost reductions in the long term.

## Calculations
Approximately 50mL of blood is taken from each crab[^"6"], multiplied by the estimated 600,000 crabs harvested annually equals 30 million mL. We assume that an equivalent amount of rFC is needed to meet those annual testing needs, although recent testing and studies suggest that rFC is more efficient and thus may require even less volume[^"7"].
Existing endotoxin testing protocols using LAL will need to be adapted to using rFC. Pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers would need to invest in these new protocols and laboratories would need regulatory approvals to carry them out. All of this would have associated costs to meet the demand.
Conservation and preservation of ecosystem services where the crabs were harvested would be the main environmental benefit. Reducing reliance on a finite biological resource would reduce the risk of supply shortages and create long-term cost savings from a stable and scalable synthetic production.

## Implementation
This new method faces challenges within the industry, which has used traditional methods for approximately 40 years. Along with the need to recognize the validity of the tests by all sectors, using new methods would require extensive alteration of current equipment and practices[^"1"]. Recently rFC has been approved to the US Pharmacopeia and has begun to see a wider use[^"8"], though it may take some time for full adoption to be mandatory, especially globally.
