The use of development sets as an urban planning methodology may greatly reduce the need for motorized transportation, including driving, buses, and rail. The concept is also known as the 15 minute city.

A development set design should seek to provide six basic functions within a 15 minute walk or bike ride from each dwelling: living, working, commerce, health care, education, and entertainment [^"16"]. Tools such as online shopping and remote work create an opportunity for less automobile-dependent cities [^"16"].

Designing a city by a development set methodology requires long-term planning, such as has been embarked by Singapore [^"14"], several cities in China [^"15"], Paris [^"27"], Melbourne [^"4"], and other cities.

A smaller-scale implementation of development set concepts is that of the mixed-used development.
