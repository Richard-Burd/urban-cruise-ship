## Description

We propose that cities adopt development set patterns as described above. Costs and benefits are based on an a study of a mixed use development in Eugene, Oregon [^"1"]. However, each city should study their own economic picture individually to determine whether and how to pursue a development set model. 


## Costs

A proposed downtown waterfront redevelopment in Eugene would cost $138,750,000, including $100 million for building construction, about $18 million for infrastructure, $11 million for parks, and the remainder for land acquisition and other amenities.

We estimate that there is a market potential for 100 million people in the United States to live in dense, highly mixed environments such as envisioned in the Eugene plan. Replicating the plan for all of them would cost $15.4 trillion, or $1.54 trillion per year if the costs are spread over 10 years.


## Benefits

The market value of the buildings is taken to be their construction cost at $100 million, or $10 million per year [^"1"]. The development will provide at least 360 homes, in addition to commercial and retail space, which we estimate to house 900 people. With an agglomeration elasticity of 0.1 (0.1% per-capita wealth increase for a 1% regional population increase), a regional GDP of about $18 billion, and a regional population of about 383,000, the external agglomeration benefit is about $4.4 million per year, or around $89 million at a 5% discount rate. With an external cost of driving of 60 cents per mile [^"3"], 2.6 miles of driving per day saved by living downtown [^"1"], and assuming 1.5 drivers per household, the external costs of driving saved is $6.1 million if valued at a 5% discount rate.

For 100 million people, the annual benefits include $1.11 trillion for buildings, 488 billion for agglomeration benefits, and $34 billion for saved driving externalities.

Assuming 60% of the population living in mixed use developments drive, that drivers save on average 2.6 miles per day, that the average car gets 24.4 miles per gallon [^"5"], that each gallon of gasoline emits 8,887 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> [^"6"], and valuing greenhouse gas emissions at $50/ton CO<sub>2</sub>e, the carbon reduction over can be valued at $1.06 billion. The remaining pollution costs--air pollution and noise pollution--can similarly be valued at $1.8 billion [^"3"].

Providing dense, mixed use development to 100 million American would save 42 thousand square kilometers of habitat, if the residents move from single family homes on median lots to midrise apartments. This assumes that, in addition to the residential area savings, commercial, transportation, institutional, land area undergo commensurate savings, but not industrial land or open space.


## Implementation

A development set design should seek to provide six basic functions within a 15 minute walk or bike ride from each dwelling: living, working, commerce, health care, education, and entertainment [^"16"]. Tools such as online shopping and remote work create an opportunity for less automobile-dependent cities [^"16"].

For cities to enumerate and place all conceivable needs of the population within walking distance of each resident would exceed the capability of any planning system. Instead, the best chance of achieving a dense, highly mixed urban environment is available through cities establishing regions with limited zoning restrictions, to allow density and a range of businesses to develop [^"2"].

Designing a city by a development set methodology requires long-term planning, such as has been embarked by Singapore [^"14"], several cities in China [^"15"], Paris [^"27"], Melbourne [^"4"], and other cities.
