## Description

We examine alternative shipping fuels with the aim of reducing emissions.

## Background

Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
- Current State: LNG is currently leading in alternative fuel ship ordering. In 2022, 222 ships (81% of total alternative fuel orders) were ordered with LNG. [^"1"]
- Market Outlook: LNG is expected to continue dominating alternative fuel orders in 2023. [^"1"]

Biofuels
- Market Value: The global marine biofuel market was valued at US$ 3.5 billion in 2022 and is predicted to expand rapidly at a 7.5% CAGR between 2023 and 2033, potentially reaching US$ 7.62 billion by 2033​​.
- Environmental and Economic Factors: Marine biofuels offer reduced carbon footprints and air pollutants, contributing significantly to sustainable shipping practices and climate change mitigation efforts. Financial incentives, subsidies, and tax breaks are enhancing the economic viability of marine biofuels​​​​. [^"2"]

Hydrogen and Ammonia
- Future Projections: Hydrogen-based fuels, particularly e-ammonia, are projected to emerge as a major maritime fuel, capturing 20% to 60% of the total shipping fuels by 2050. E-ammonia alone might hold an average share of 35% by 2050​​. [^"3"]
- Investment and Development Dynamics: The industry is grappling with challenges in balancing demand, supply, and investment in alternative fuel pathways.  [^"3"]

Electric Batteries
- Market Growth: The electric ship market is projected to grow from USD 3.3 billion in 2022 to USD 14.2 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 20.0%​​. [^"4"]
- Adoption and Retrofitting: The hybrid electric segment, particularly for retrofitting existing ships, is leading the electric ship market. Retrofitting is seen as a key method for electrifying larger ships with significant operational life left​​. [^"4"]
- Challenges and Opportunities: The sector faces challenges like limited range and capacity of fully electric ships and high initial capital expenditure. [^"4"]
