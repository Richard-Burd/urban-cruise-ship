## Description

We examine four alternative shipping fuels with the aim of reducing emissions.

## Background

Liquefied natural gas is currently leading in alternative fuel ship ordering. In 2022, 222 ships (81% of total alternative fuel orders) were ordered with LNG [^"1"], with LNG expected to continue dominating alternative fuel orders in 2023 [^"1"].

The global marine biofuel market was valued at US$ 3.5 billion in 2022 and is predicted to expand at a 7.5% compound annual growth rate between 2023 and 2033, reaching US$ 7.62 billion by 2033​​. Marine biofuels offer reduced carbon footprints and air pollutants, contributing significantly to sustainable shipping practices and climate change mitigation efforts. Financial incentives, subsidies, and tax breaks are enhancing the economic viability of marine biofuels​​​​. [^"2"]

Hydrogen-based fuels, particularly electrolyzed ammonia, are projected to emerge as a major maritime fuel, capturing 20% to 60% of the total shipping fuels by 2050. E-ammonia alone might hold an average share of 35% by 2050​​ [^"3"]. The industry is grappling with challenges in balancing demand, supply, and investment in alternative fuel pathways [^"3"].

The electric ship market is projected to grow from $3.3 billion in 2022 to $14.2 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate of 20.0%​ [^"4"]. The hybrid electric segment, particularly for retrofitting existing ships, is leading the electric ship market. Retrofitting is seen as a key method for electrifying larger ships with significant operational life left​​ [^"4"].
- Challenges and Opportunities: The sector faces challenges like limited range and capacity of fully electric ships and high initial capital expenditure. [^"4"]
