## Description
We recommend that national governments invest further in algae biofuel research and development.

## Background
Algae-based biofuels are considered carbon-neutral--meaning that the carbon dioxide absorbed by algae during their growth offsets the COâ‚‚ emitted when the biofuel is burned--use land efficiently, can use wastewater [^"3"], and reduce air pollution upon combustion [^"4"].

The process of producing algae biofuel involves cultivation, harvesting, lipid extraction, and then converting the extracted lipids to biofuels in a process called transesterification. This involves an alcohol (usually methanol) in the presence of a catalyst to produce biodiesel. Other processes can also be used, such as hydrothermal liquefaction [^"5"]. 

An economic analysis of biofuel production in South Africa resulted in a cost of $2.00 to $2.09 per liter [^"1"]. With the world average price of diesel at $1.25 per liter worldwide [^"6"], there remains needed progress for algae-derived biodiesel to become a competitive alternative. However, algal biofuels show potential for economical feasibility [^"1"].


## Implementation
National governments can implement further R&D in algae-based biofuels by funding R&D consortia and pilot projects, establishing policy incentives, fostering international collaborations, addressing technical challenges, and investing in advanced biofuel production methods.
