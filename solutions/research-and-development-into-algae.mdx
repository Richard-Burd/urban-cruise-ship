## Description
We recommend that national governments invest further in algae biofuel research and development.

## Background
Most transportation fuel is derived from petroleum, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. These fossil fuels contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particulate matter pollution, and environmental degradation. Algae-based biofuels are an alternative energy source derived from microalgae, which can be converted into biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, and jet fuel. Unlike traditional biofuels (e.g., corn ethanol or soybean biodiesel), algae have higher yields per acre and do not compete with food crops for arable land.

Algae-based biofuels are considered carbon-neutral, meaning that the carbon dioxide absorbed by algae during their growth offsets the CO₂ emitted when the biofuel is burned. They use land efficiently, can use wastewater to reduce freshwater consumption [^"3"], and reduce air pollution upon combustion [^"4"].

The process of producing algae biofuel involves cultivation, harvesting, lipid extraction, and then converting the extracted lipids to biofuels in a process called transesterification. This involves an alcohol (usually methanol) in the presence of a catalyst to produce biodiesel. Other processes can also be used, such as hydrothermal liquefaction [^"5"]. 

An economic analysis of biofuel production in South Africa resulted in a cost of $2.00 to $2.09 per liter [^"1"]. Further economic assessments report selling cost of algal fuel between $0.43 and $7.93 per liter[^"8"]. With the world average price of diesel at $1.25 per liter worldwide [^"6"], there remains needed progress for algae-derived biodiesel to become a competitive alternative. However, algal biofuels show potential for economic feasibility [^"1"].

## Calculations
R&D efforts are focused on improving strain selection, increasing lipid yields, and optimizing harvesting methods. It is estimated that these focused efforts will achieve a cost parity with other diesel fuels with an annual investment of $250 million over a period of 10 years[^"8"].

Algae-derived biodiesel is estimated to reduce lifecycle GHG emissions by 60% compared to petroleum diesel[^"9"].

Diesel fuel consumption in the U.S. creates 455 million metric tons of  CO2 emissions annually[^"10"], that means there is a potential to reduce CO2 emissions by 273 million metric tons in the U.S. alone. 

## Implementation
National governments can implement further R&D in algae-based biofuels by funding R&D consortia and pilot projects, establishing policy incentives, fostering international collaborations, addressing technical challenges, and investing in advanced biofuel production methods.

Once cost parity is achieved, scaling of production to meet demands would require bioreactors or open-pond systems, both of which present challenges such as contamination and would need further investment.
