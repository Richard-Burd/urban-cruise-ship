## Description

We recommend world governments invest further in algae biofuel research and development.

## Background


Algae-based biofuels are considered carbon-neutral, meaning that the carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbed by algae during their growth offsets the CO2 emitted when the biofuel is burned[^"3"]. Other beneficial qualities include:

- Efficient Land Use: Unlike terrestrial crop-based biofuels, which compete for land with food production, microalgae have higher productivity and lower land requirements[^"3"].

- Wastewater Utilization: Algae can be cultivated using wastewater, which serves the dual purpose of treating the water by nutrient sequestration and producing biomass for biofuel[^"3"].

- Emission Reduction: Studies have shown that using algal biodiesel blends in vehicles can significantly reduce emissions of carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and smoke opacity[^"4"].

The process of producing algae biofuel involves cultivation, harvesting, lipid extraction, and then converting the extracted lipids to biofuels in a process called transesterification. This involves an alcohol (usually methanol) in the presence of a catalyst to produce biodiesel. Other processes can also be used, such as hydrothermal liquefaction[^"5"]. 

An economic analysis of biofuel production in South Africa resulted in a cost of $2.00 to $2.09 per liter[^"1"]. With the world average price of diesel at $1.25 USD per liter worldwide[^"6"], there remains work to be done for algae-derived biodiesel to become a competitive alternative, however, the study did conclude that the projects were economically feasible[^"1"].


## Implementation

World governments can implement further R&D in algae-based biofuels by funding R&D consortia and pilot projects, establishing policy incentives, fostering international collaborations, addressing technical challenges, and investing in advanced biofuel production methods.
