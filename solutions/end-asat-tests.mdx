Antisatellite tests, such as the 2007 Chinese test and the 2021 Russian test, are a major source of orbital debris and a risk to future orbital activities. As of 2007, the Chinese test alone was responsible for over 10% of the large pieces (at least 10 centimeters) of orbital debris [29].

Experts debate the motivation behind the Chinese test and Chinese ASAT pursuits. Their goal may be to increase the cost and risk for an American defense of Taiwan, should China attack that island, or it may be fear that American space capability will nullify the Chinese nuclear deterrent [23].

The Outer Space Treaty may forbid destructive ASAT testing under the Outer Space Treaty, which requires nations in their space activities to show "due regard to the corresponding interests of all other States Parties to the Treaty" [21]. Nevertheless, the Outer Space Treaty has not been sufficient to stop ASAT testing, and a new agreement is desirable. On possibility is the International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities, though negotiations are currently stalled [21].

If a full legal ban on destructive ASAT testing is infeasible, then an alternative is legally binding limitations on the number of tests, the altitude of tests so as not to create long-lasting debris fields, and notification requirements [20].
