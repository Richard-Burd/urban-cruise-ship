## Description

We promote continued research and development into precision agriculture including education and outreach programs to boost adoption of this technology into the industry.

## Background

Precision agriculture digital technologies include: soil maps, yield monitors, yield maps, variable rate technologies, auto-guidance systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, and satellite imagery[^”1”]. Benefits include: profitability, productivity, sustainability, crop quality, food safety, environmental protection, on-farm quality of life, and rural economic development[^”2”]. While these benefits have been well documented, adoption rates have been slow due to adjustment costs, risk preferences, farm size, and lack of knowledge and training as well as other various reasons[^”1”]. In the U.S. precision agriculture technologies were used in about 40% of corn and soybean acres in 2012[^”3”].

Upcoming technologies that are being worked on to include in precision agriculture are: wireless sensor networks, Internet of Things connectivity, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning[^”4”].

## Calculations

The Precision Farming market was valued at 4.1 billion in 2022 and increased to 7.5 billion in 2023, with a projected compound annual growth rate of 8%[^”5”].

We recommend the following annual investment diversification.

Public investment through Federal-State partnerships: $7.64 billion (a return to peak-spending of 2002)[^”6”].

Private investment from for profit companies such as Deere and Co.: $2.3 billion[^”7”].

Totaling $9.94 billion in annual investment cost.

The USDA Economic Research service has calculated that for every $1 spend on agricultural R&D that there is $20 in benefit to the economy[^”6”]. This rate would mean a benefit of $198.8 billion annually.

## Implementation

Precision agriculture is information intense and will require continued advances in networking and computer processing power in order to fully realize its potential[^”8”].
