## Description

We propose that cities incoporate ecosystem services values (ESV) into land assessment, and assess fees on land conversion commensurate with their ecosystem values.

## Background

Evaluating the financial value of ecosystem services provided by agricultural land can help raise awareness about the value of land under agricultural use which is lost due to urban development, as well as provide a baseline for fees to be assessed.[^"5"]

Urban planning tools and strategies can be designed to integrate ecosystem services. This can be achieved through the design of nature-based solutions (NbSs) that introduce important ecological functions aiding human well-being and mitigating the loss of soil. The methodology proposed in a study involves analyzing the variation of ecosystem services in relation to land use scenarios generated by urban planning[^"2"].

Implementing Nature-Based Solutions (NbSs): NbSs are actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems. They address societal challenges such as climate change, food and water security, or natural disasters effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. Some actions farmers can implement in the new Rural Development Programs can be considered as NbSs and could affect the quantity, quality, and time of some ecosystem services related to water regulation and supply, nitrogen adsorption, and erosion protection[^"3"].

Prioritizing Development Based on Ecosystem Services Loss: The ecological losses incurred by land development vary with the different types of land. Therefore, it's crucial to prioritize development based on the projected losses of ecosystem services. This can help prevent ecological risks resulting from land development[^"4"].

## Implementation

ESV fee assessments could be utilized to mitigate climate change by putting these funds into protective environmental measures.
