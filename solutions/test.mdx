## Description


food-waste-fefo


We recommend food manufacturers and retailers implement a First Expired First Out method of inventory management.


## Background


Food inventories are commonly managed using the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method, especially in businesses dealing with perishable or time-sensitive goods, such as restaurants. This method assumes that the oldest inventory items are sold or used first, helping to ensure freshness, reduce waste, and maximize profitability[^"1"]. However, this methodology prioritizes items in the order they are received instead of the product's freshness.


First Expired First Out (FEFO) is an inventory management technique that prioritizes the sale or use of products with the shortest expiry dates[^"3"] [^"5"].


Benefits include:


- Food Freshness: FEFO ensures that foods further from their expiration date are sold more consistently than a first in, first out inventory strategy[^"3"].

- Waste Reduction: FEFO helps minimize waste by ensuring that products are consumed before expiration dates. This reduces the likelihood of having unsellable goods on the shelves[^"3"].

- Cost Reduction: By minimizing waste, FEFO can help to reduce costs associated with returns and spoilage. It also helps to avoid the cost of stock expiring on the shelf[^"3"].

## Implementation

FEFO requires detailed record-keeping, intelligent storage planning, and larger storage spaces. In addition, it requires strong management and company buy-in to be effective. First In First Out is a simpler strategy, and so is often used instead of FEFO even though it can significantly affect product loss[^"4"][^"5"].
