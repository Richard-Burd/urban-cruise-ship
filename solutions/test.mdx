## Description

We recommend businesses, especially those in the courier and delivery sector, adopt the use of e-bikes for package delivery in high-density areas as a strategy to reduce traffic, reduce pollution, and improve delivery service.

## Background

The initial investment for an e-bike fleet includes the purchase of the e-bikes, installation of charging stations, and staff training. However, these costs are offset by savings in fuel and maintenance costs associated with traditional delivery trucks. [^"1"] Companies operating in urban areas can save 45% on delivery costs within urban areas. [^"6"]

A study done by the University of Washington compares cargo e-bikes to delivery trucks. [^"5"]
- Delivery Trucks emit 246 grams of CO2e per Km, verses 7 grams with e-bikes
- Delivery Trucks are more likely to fail to deliver the package on the first try, requiring reshipment
- Delivery Trucks are able to make more delivery locations per hour than ebikes, but this does not factor in the walking time required by the drivers, and potential fines for double parking. Ebikes are able to get closer to the final destination with their vehicle.

The NYC Department of Transportation has found that cargo e-bikes save 7 tons of CO2 emissions per year per bike. [^"8"]

E-bikes navigate urban environments more efficiently than trucks, leading to faster delivery times and increased productivity.  [^"1"] A study on cargo bike delivery concept selection suggests that renting cargo bikes from a third-party provider is the most cost-effective solution for e-commerce companies. [^"2"]

Additional benefits include:

Efficiency: E-bikes can navigate through traffic jams.  [^"1"]
Access: E-bikes can easily access narrow streets, pedestrian zones, and low emission zones.  [^"1"]
Health Benefits: Physical activity from cycling is beneficial for couriers' health. [^"3"]


## Implementation

Investing in e-bike fleets is more cost-effective in the long run, considering the savings on fuel and maintenance. [^"2"]

Legislation: While legislation in 2019 allowed e-bikes to travel through public parks, there's a need for more uniform e-bike laws across states.[^"9"] The National Institute for Transportation and Communities advise that devices going faster than 20 mph do not belong in bicycle lanes and shared-use paths, and limiting the speeds of electric bikes in these areas is advised. Presently, each state and municipality in the state can have its own local rules, which results in a confusing patchwork. [^"4"]
