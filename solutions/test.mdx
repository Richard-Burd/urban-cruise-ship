## Description

We recommend the US military implement renewable microgrids into temporary bases that primarily rely on diesel generator power as a way to reduce environmental impact.

## Background

Environmental impact reductions and efficient energy use have been a growing focus of military and peacekeeping operations around the world [^"2"] [^"5"]. Renewable microgrids have been examined as a solution to reduce the use of diesel generators on base [^"1"]. The U.S. Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) utility bill is almost $4 billion per year, with over ¼ of this used by military bases [^"6"]. In 2023, the global market for military power generators is expected to account for about 3% to 6% of the worldwide generator sales market [^"8"]. Currently, diesel generators remain the top-selling category. However, with tightening environmental laws due to increasing air pollution levels, the market is expected to shift to less carbon intensive power solutions [^"9"].

Smart Hybrid Energy System (SHES) Grids are designed to be packed in standard shipping 20 ft containers. These microgrids are modular and scalable for different sizes of base camps [^"1"].

#### Annual values are calculated using an 8% discount rate and a social cost of carbon of $141.40 per ton. Source [^"1"] [^"20"] [^"19"] [^"14"] [^"18"] [^"21"] [^"22"] [^"7"].

While the exact number of forward operating bases, temporary bases, or "lily pad" bases that the US military operates and runs soley on diesel generator power is not known, we estimate 200 such bases would be affected by this solution based upon the available data [^"21"] [^"22"] [^"7"].

We calculate the costs of the components needed based on current market prices [^"20"] [^"19"] [^"14"] [^"18"]. 

## Implementation

While base commanders may not be prioritizing energy efficiency, studies have shown a positive impact for the use of renewable energy in remote bases and can help operations by increasing the energy security of a given base [^"10"].
