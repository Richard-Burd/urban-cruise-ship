## Description

We recommend the United States federal government enhance radon monitoring and outreach within low-income households, providing free testing.

## Background

Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that emanates from the earth's crust. It is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, making it impossible to detect without specialized equipment. When inhaled, radon gas decays into radioactive particles that can become trapped in the lungs, damaging lung tissue over time and potentially leading to lung cancer.[^"3"] The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that radon is responsible for about 21,000 lung cancer deaths annually in the U.S.[^"2"]

Low-income households, both owned and rented, often lack the resources to carry out radon testing and mitigation. Additionally, these demographics may lack awareness of the risks associated with radon exposure and the availability of testing and mitigation resources.[^"4"]

Radon test kits range from $17 to $27 USD each. Treating radon problems in a home can cost upwards of $1000.[^"6"] There is a patchwork of states that provide free kits to lower income households, as well as loan programs and grants for mitigation[^"8"] [^"9"], however, a federal program could allow everyone in the United States to be able to obtain these kits.

## Benefits

It is estimated that every dollar spent on radon testing and repairs returns $11 to $20.[^"7"]

## Implementation

Work on radon exposure legislation is ongoing. In 2011, The Federal Radon Action Plan was released. The National Radon Action Plan 2021-25 (NRAP) is another initiative to spur testing, awareness, and financing toward radon mitigation and risk reduction. 

Awareness of the risks of radon exposure is still low in low-income households. A public health campaign could help raise awareness, and promote testing.[^”4”]
