## Description

We recommend afforestation or preventing new deforestation as a strategy to sequester carbon.

## Background
Increasing Earth's forest cover, whether through reducing deforestation or active afforestation, will sequester carbon, though the exact amount is highly uncertain. Tree restoration has the highest potential of any solution or technology to date for carbon sequestration [^"5"].

Estimates of the carbon sequestration potential of tree planting vary widely, ranging from 113 [^"22"] to 564 billion tons CO<sub>2</sub>e [^"1"], or 3-14 years of emissions at present. The main study cited in this solution estimates a total of 205.6 gigatons CO<sub>2</sub>e with an uncertainty range of 133.2 to 276.2 GtC [^"5"].

Reforestation has been examined as a solution for ground-level ozone abatement. Ground-level ozone is estimated to cause 152,000 deaths per year as of 2014. In addition, it is linked to increased respiratory and cardiovascular disease. It also has been shown to reduce crop productivity. Current abatement techniques have focused on economic incentives and technological solutions to reduce pollutants which are responsible for the formation of ozone. [^"9"].

Based on the US case study, our scenario of 899 million hectares of afforestation could reduce ground-level ozone by 22.21 megatons and NO<sub>x</sub> by 4.29 megatons per year [^"9"]. Using a $64,075 per ton average of health benefits (including decreased mortality and quality of life years) for NO<sub>x</sub> reductions, we estimate $274.88 billion/year benefit based upon long-term benefits with a 7 percent discount rate [^"24"]. However, pending further study, we do not include these into the above metric totals.


## Calculations

We use a study for US project costs for national forests to estimate project costs of $1,178 per hectare. These could involve financial incentives or subsidies for private landowners or projects to restock potential forest areas [^"6"].

## Implementation
Several pieces of legislation introduced in the United States Congress would promote tree planting [^"11"]. General approaches including subsidies for tree planting, modeled after the 45Q program for carbon capture and sequestration or renewable energy production tax credits; and federal funding for tree planting on public lands, modeled after other forms of infrastructure investment [^"11"].

Carbon pricing has been studied as a means to incentivize tree planting and may provide a cost-effective solution to drive markets towards increased forest cover [^"8"].
