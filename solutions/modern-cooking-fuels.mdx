## Description
We promote that development agencies prioritize the spread of modern cooking fuels and the cookstoves to use them. We explore the costs and benefits of halving the population without access to liquified petroleum gas (LPG).

## Background
2.7 billion people do not have access to modern cooking fuels and technologies[^”1”],[^”2”].

Modern fuels include natural gas, LPG, diesel, and renewables such as biodiesel and bio-ethanol. These fuels can be used more efficiently through the technology of improved cookstoves[^”1”].

Benefits include social and economic development (including productivity and time gains), improved health, gender impacts, and environmental impacts[^”1”]. There are also satisfaction benefits such as reduction in smoke, speed of cooking, ease of use, and taste of the food[^”2”].

Indoor air pollution from traditional biomass causes 3.8 million premature deaths every year[^”2”].


## Calculations
Annual economic benefits are valued at $100 billion and include less expenditure on health care, health-related productivity gains, fuel collection and cooking time savings, and environmental impacts[^”3”].

Annual net costs are valued at $14.4 billion and include fuel, stove, and program costs, from which monetary fuel cost savings are subtracted to estimate net costs[^”3”].


## Implementation
Public and private finance have a key role to play in advancing clean cooking, especially in regions without the fiscal space to drive the required investment through public funds[^”4”]. Concessional and climate financing will be needed to support projects in the poorest regions[^”4”].
