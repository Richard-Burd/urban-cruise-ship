## Description
We promote that development agencies prioritize the spread of modern cooking fuels and the cookstoves to use them.

## Background
Modern fuels include natural gas, LPG, diesel, and renewables such as biodiesel and bio-ethanol. These fuels can be used more efficiently through the technology of improved cookstoves[^”1”].

Benefits include social and economic development (including productivity and time gains), improved health, gender impacts, and environmental impacts[^”1”]. There are also satisfaction benefits such as reduction in smoke, speed of cooking, ease of use, and taste of the food[^”2”].


## Calculations
2.7 billion people do not have access to modern cooking fuels and technologies[^”1”],[^”2”].

Indoor air pollution from traditional biomass causes 3.8 million premature deaths every year[^”2”].


## Implementation
