import SolutionDropdown from '/components/SolutionDropdown.js'

export const problem = "Wildfire Damage";
export const solution = "Controlled Burns";

Suppression, though intended to reduce wildfire damage, does not show long-term effectiveness. Better use of controlled burns, as well as strategic forest thinning, will better help manage risk.

export default ({ children }) =>
