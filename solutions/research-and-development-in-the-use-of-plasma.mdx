## Description
We promote investing in research and development of plasma use in agriculture.


## Background
Plasma can be used in multiple phases during the process of food production. There is currently research being done on seeds and germination, plant growing and production, and harvesting and processing. There is a need to coordinate these research efforts to create standardization in the methodology which will aid in transferring this technology to the industry[^”1”].

Plasma treatments have been shown to stimulate seed germination, enhance root development, and increase overall crop productivity[^”2”]. Plasma can also alter the physiochemical properties of soil which increases nutrient availability and uptake and reduces fertilizer requirements[^”2”].

The antimicrobial properties of plasma along with it’s ability to induce systemic resistance in plants means it can be used for pest and disease management as well making it an alternative to chemical based pesticides[^”2”].

Plasma in conjunction with plasma-activated-water (PAW) have been shown to alleviate stress from drought, salinity, and extreme temperatures by activating stress-responsive genes and enhancing antioxidant defense mechanisms[^”2”].

## Implementation
The only way plasma can produce sufficiently significant results to provide industrial advantages, is by the cumulative effect of small improvements[^”1”]. In order to do this, all experiments must be meticulously thorough in describing every aspect of the protocol used, as well as complete reporting of all results[^”1”].
