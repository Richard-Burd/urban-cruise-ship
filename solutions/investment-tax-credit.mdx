## Background
The Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) has been pivotal in subsidizing investments in clean energy, offering a 30% reduction in the cost of solar installations[^"4"]. This tax credit is instrumental in promoting sustainable energy solutions, with broad implications for environmental and economic policies [^"1"]. 
The Federal Solar ITC was introduced to lower the financial barriers to solar energy adoption. Over the years, this policy has significantly boosted the installation of solar systems across residential and commercial sectors in the U.S. The current benefits extend beyond environmental impacts, contributing to job creation and technological innovation in renewable energy sectors [^"3"]. Historical data suggest a substantial increase in solar capacity directly linked to this tax credit, which also aligns with federal emissions reduction targets [^"2"].

## Calculations
New solar installation was $2.12 billion in 2023[^"5"]. 30% covered by the Federal Solar ITC would be $.64 billion, this is counted as both a cost and a benefit.
There is an estimated $9,000 in energy savings over the lifetime of new systems[^"6"]. With an expected lifetime of 25 years[^"7"], that would be an annual benefit of $360. In 2022, there were 671,596 new residential solar systems installed[^"8"] equaling a total of $242 million in additional benefit.

## Implementation
The tax credit would be extended by the U.S. congress.
