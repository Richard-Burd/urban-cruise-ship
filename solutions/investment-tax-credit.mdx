## Description

We recommend the  federal solar investment tax credit be extended.


## Background

The Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) has been pivotal in subsidizing investments in clean energy, offering a 30% reduction in the cost of solar installations[^"18"]. This tax credit is instrumental in promoting sustainable energy solutions, with broad implications for environmental and economic policies [^"1"]. 

The Federal Solar ITC was introduced to lower the financial barriers to solar energy adoption. Over the years, this policy has significantly boosted the installation of solar systems across residential and commercial sectors in the U.S. The current benefits extend beyond environmental impacts, contributing to job creation and technological innovation in renewable energy sectors [^"3"]. Historical data suggest a substantial increase in solar capacity directly linked to this tax credit, which also aligns with federal emissions reduction targets [^"2"].

## Implementation

The tax credit would be extended by the US congress.
