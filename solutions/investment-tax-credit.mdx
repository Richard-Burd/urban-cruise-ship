## Description
We recommend the  federal solar investment tax credit be extended with modifications.


## Background
The Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) has been pivotal in subsidizing investments in clean energy, offering a 30% reduction in the cost of solar installations[^"4"]. This tax credit is instrumental in promoting sustainable energy solutions, with broad implications for environmental and economic policies [^"1"]. 
The Federal Solar ITC was introduced to lower the financial barriers to solar energy adoption. Over the years, this policy has significantly boosted the installation of solar systems across residential and commercial sectors in the U.S. The current benefits extend beyond environmental impacts, contributing to job creation and technological innovation in renewable energy sectors [^"3"]. Historical data suggest a substantial increase in solar capacity directly linked to this tax credit, which also aligns with federal emissions reduction targets [^"2"].

In 2016, the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory [^"9"] modeled that an extension of the ITC would result in an additional 18 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity from 2015 to 2030, compared to an additional 450 GW that were modeled as the baseline. Most of the additional deployment would occur by the mid-2020s, suggesting that by then, mature renewable energy technologies will benefit little from additional subsidies.

## Implementation
The tax credit would be extended by the U.S. Congress. As discussed above in the context of the Production Tax Credit, we recommend that the ITC be restricted to less mature technologies, such as those with less than 3% of electricity market penetration, to insure that the credit supports those technologies that may benefit from learning from additional deployment [^"10"].
