## Description
We propose installing 50 gigawatt-hours of capacity of electrical energy storage batteries at strategic locations to ease grid network load balancing.

## Calculations

Sidhu et al.[^"1"] estimate costs and benefits, including social costs and benefits, of a battery installation with a storage capacity of 10 megawatt-hours and a power capacity of 6 megawatts in Britain. As many elements of the calculations are uncertain, several model runs were conducted using a Monte Carlo simulation. Four to seven years of project costs declines resulting from a learning curve effect were included in the calculations. The per-megawatt-hour costs are then applied the proposed 50 GWh of storage.

Several other researchers have estimated costs and benefits of battery energy storage in different contexts.

## Implementation
Individual utilities should study whether grid batteries make sense in their context, and if so, build them. Depending on the market, energy storage technologies and their applications can be subject to different regulatory context and policies [^"1"].
