## Description
We propose installing 50GWh capacity of electrical energy storage batteries at strategic locations to ease grid network load balancing.

## Calculations

Cost calculations used 2020 projected numbers converted to USD. Benefit calculations were averaged and then converted to 2020 USD. Then those numbers are multiplied by 5,000 to meet our goal of installing 50GWh worth of EES batteries. All numbers are derived from Sidhu et al.[^”1”].

## Implementation
Individual utilities should study whether grid batteries make sense in their context, and if so, build them. Depending on the market, EES technologies and their applications can be subject to different regulatory context and policies[^”1”].
