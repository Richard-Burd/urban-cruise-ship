## Description
We propose to institute worldwide nuclear reactors standardizations to reduce construction costs and build times.

## Background
Econometric studies attribute construction costs escalation to a lack of standardization, an increase in complexity of new reactors, and safety related regulatory interventions[^”1”].

The average construction time of reactors that started since 2004 is 10 years, twice what is usually announced by nuclear vendors [^”1”].

Upfront construction costs account between 60% and 80% of nuclear power levelized costs[^”1”]. This means that any unexpected increase of those costs can significantly undermine nuclear reactors profitability and can lead to abandon ongoing construction projects[^”1”].

## Calculations
 ‘Gen III’ nuclear technologies construction costs expectations per kilowatt is $5,579.88[^”1”].


## Implementation
The overnight capitol cost will need to be reduced from $12,748kWe to $3,000kWe in order to be commercially viable[^”2”].
