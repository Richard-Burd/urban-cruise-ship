## Description
We propose worldwide nuclear reactors standardizations to reduce construction costs and build times.

## Background
Econometric studies attribute construction costs escalation to a lack of standardization, an increase in complexity of new reactors, and safety related regulatory interventions, with the average construction time of reactors that have started since 2004 extending to 10 years, twice the projected timeframe by vendors [^"1"].

Upfront construction costs account between 60% and 80% of nuclear power levelized costs, which creates a risk that unexpected construction cost increases will undermine nuclear reactors' profitability and can lead to abandonment of ongoing construction projects [^"1"].

## Calculations
'Generation III' nuclear technologies construction costs expectations per kilowatt is $5,579.88 [^"1"].


## Implementation
The overnight capital cost will need to be reduced from $12,748kWe to $3,000kWe in order to be commercially viable [^"2"]. France has shown the potential for standardization, only allowing three standardized designs, reducing plant construction costs by 30-40% and improving safety by insuring that all components have been thoroughly tested [^"3"]. However, there is a risk that standardization could constrain the space for possible innovation [^"3"].
