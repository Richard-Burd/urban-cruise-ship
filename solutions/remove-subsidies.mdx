## Background

Fossil fuel subsidies can be offered to producers or consumers. While determining the exact level of subsidies is difficult, as many are offered by subnational governments, it is clear that most are offered to consumers. The International Monetary Fund [^"8"] estimates that as of 2023, $53 billion of subsidies were offered to producers and $729 billion to consumers. Consumer subsidies are elevated due to ongoing short-term COVID-19 relief measures, and they are expected to decrease to just over $600 billion later in the decade. Consumer subsidies may take the form of artificially reduced prices for gasoline or heating oil, support for politically favored industries with high energy consumption, and other measures. Subsidies tend to be higher in fossil fuel-producing countries.

The IMF also defines unpriced externalities as subsidies [^"8"]. At $5.7 trillion, these unpriced externalities, which include damages from climate change, air pollution, traffic congestion, and other harmful results of fossil fuel usage, dwarf direct subsidies. Although we advocate addressing these externalities--see our above analysis of carbon pricing--we do not classify them as subsidies for the purposes of this analysis.

Fuel subsidies tend to be regressive, meaning that they disproportionately help high-income citizens [^"3"], but in some cases they are targetted to low-income citizens, who spend up to 10% of their income [^"3"] on energy-intensive goods and are more sensitive to the price of them [^"6"]. More than half the impact of repealing fossil fuel subsidies would be felt by consumers indirectly in energy-intensive goods, rather than directly on the purchase of energy [^"2"].

## Calculations

Couharde and Mouhoud [^"6"] estimate a deadweight loss of $60 billion (2024 dollars) of fossil fuel subsidies, which is a loss of economic efficiency as a result of price distortion. This figure is distinct from the gross amount spent by governments on subsidies. Several estimates [^"9"],[^"10"],[^"1"],[^"8"] have been made of the greenhouse gas reduction potential from removing subsidies; we use that of Jewell et al. [^"7"] and take their midpoint of 1.25 billion tons of carbon dioxide. The study of Jewell et. al accounts for potential backfiring, where removal of subsidies on natural gas and oil results in an increase in emissions by stimulating the consumption of coal.

We have not estimated a monetary cost to fossil fuel subsidy removal, though given the persistence of subsidies, this is not to imply that subsidy removal is easy or free of drawbacks, as described below.

## Implementation

As with carbon pricing, to gain public acceptance, fossil fuel subsidy removal requires that the expenditures saved by the government be used for other priorities that benefit low-income citizens [^"11"]. Failure to address the needs of lower-income citizens, including those above the poverty line, will likely result in opposition to the subsidy removal and may even threaten the stability of regimes [^"12"]. Addressing the needs of lower-income citizens requires making the benefits of revenue recycling available to a broad base of citizens, including those above the poverty line, especially those most impacted by the subsidy removal, and no later than when the higher energy prices take effect [^"12"].

In 2013, India developed the PaHaL program to limited subsidies for liquified petroleum gas to low-income households [^"4"]. Through a Know Your Customer mechanism, PaHaL reduced subsidies to those who did not need it and thereby reduced air pollution and government expenditures [^"5"].
