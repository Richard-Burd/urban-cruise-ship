## Description
We recommend further research and development of nuclear hydrogen production.

## Background
Steam methane reforming with fossil fuels, the most common methods of hydrogen production today, carries a production cost of $1.54 to $2.30 per kilogram of hydrogen and emits 10.6 kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilogram [^"2"].

Nuclear power plants can be modified to generate hydrogen alongside electricity [^"3"]. Estimations of the levelized cost of nuclear hydrogen production range from $0.69 to $4.85 per kilogram of hydrogen, depending on the method of production [^"1"].

Low-temperature electrolysis, used in proton exchange membrane electrolyzers, uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen at relatively low temperatures. This method is safe and efficient but requires a large amount of electricity [^"1"]. High-temperature steam electrolysis operates at high temperatures (above 200 °C), using steam instead of liquid water. The high temperature reduces the electricity required for water splitting, improving efficiency over low-temperature electrolysis. Steam electrolysis uses the thermal energy in nuclear reactors to lower the energy required for hydrogen production [^"1"].

Kim et al. [^"1"] find steam electrolysis to be of the lowest cost at $0.69 per kilogram of hydrogen.

A new type of nuclear reactor with a higher coolant temperature could create a path to inexpensive hydrogen production [^"4"].

## Implementation

The cost of producing hydrogen from nuclear power is a significant barrier. It is essential to develop and commercialize more effective and economical methods and systems for hydrogen production.
