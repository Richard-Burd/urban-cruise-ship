## Description

We recommend the U.N., local governments, international organizations and other stakeholders scale up maternal prenatal care supplements in low and low-middle income countries to improve birth outcomes.

## Background

Malnutrition affects millions of women and children, especially in low-income to middle-income countries[^"3"]. Access to prenatal care has been a part of the UN General Assembly's resolution on universal health coverage, with some countries gaining high levels of success[^"4"]. Iron and folic acid prenatal supplements are provided to 36 million women in low income and low-middle income countries[^"1"]. By upgrading to a Multiple Micronutrient (MMN) supplement (containing iron and folic acid) along with Calcium, birth health outcomes will be improved, and there will be substantial decreases in infant mortality[^"5"].

Preterm and low birth weights are associated with decreased attainment of higher education, lower employment, increased likelyhood of receiving social benefits, and decreased IQ[^"1"].

#### Source [^"1"]

Benefits are derived from avoided deaths, avoided preterm births, and low birthweights. Each avoided death assumes 68 years of life using a value of statistical life caluculation which comes to $212,000 per avoided death in 2022. Preterm and low birth weights calculated as a 10% decrease in lifetime income per preterm or low birth weight birth[^"1"].

## Implementation

The costs of this intervention are in the scaling up of the supplement, building upon the current successful delivery of iron and folate[^"1"].
