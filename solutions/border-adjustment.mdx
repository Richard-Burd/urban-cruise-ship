## Description
We recommend world governments with greenhouse gas reduction policies implement border adjustments, such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAM), to equalize carbon pricing between foreign and domestic goods.

## Background
Many governments have enacted greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction policies such as emissions trading systems (ETS) and carbon taxes to address climate change. Policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions can put domestic manufacturing at a disadvantage compared to companies that produce and import products abroad in countries with less stringent policies. Companies may also move production out of the country in order to stay competitive. The effect, known as carbon leakage, is that of a country that reduces its own emissions but transfers those emissions elsewhere in the world [^"1"].

In addition to stringent emissions reduction policies leading to offshoring of industry (direct leakage), additional indirect leakage may occur when fossil fuel reduction in one country lowers the world price and stimulates consumption in another country [^"5"]. A border adjustment aims primarily at direct leakage.
Carbon border adjustments, such as Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAM), apply fees on imported goods based on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions created in their production. Depending on the country, these adjustments could also apply rebates to goods produced with high emission standards [^"3"]. In general, CBAM’s discourage carbon leakage and offshoring of emissions, incentivize foreign producers to decarbonize supply chains, increase revenue for climate investments, and support domestic industries transitioning to low-carbon operations.

The EU began implementation of CBAM in October 2023, with focus on the sectors with the highest risks of carbon leakage, such as cement, steel, electricity, and hydrogen [^"4"].

Calculations##
Estimating emissions in imported goods requires lifecycle analysis and reporting infrastructure. Full implementation of the EU CBAM administrative costs is estimated to be $324 million annually[^"7"].

We propose implementing CBAM for the United States, Canada, the EU, U.K., Japan, South Korea, Australia, Switzerland, New Zealand, and Singapore. We assume that the cost is relative to GDP using this ratio to assess application as a function of economic size.

EU $324 million, United States $762.35 million, Japan $114.35 million, U.K. $98.02 million, Canada $59.9 million, South Korea $54.45 million, Australia $46.29 million, Switzerland $24.5 million, Singapore $13.61 million, New Zealand $8.17 million[^"7"],[^"8"]. For a total of $1.506 billion annually.

Reporting systems to collect, analyze, and report climate data for corporate issuers is about an average of $533,000[^"9"]. Estimating roughly 5,000 firms where this cost would be applicable would add $2.665 billion annually.
The EU estimates that establishing and maintaining a digital CBAM registry would cost $55 million annually[^"10"]. Assuming that each of the additional nations listed above would need their own registry, that would add $550 million annually.

The EU CBAM program is estimated to reduce 90 million metric tons of CO₂e  annually[^"11"]. Purchasing of CBAM certificates is expected to generate significant revenue as well[^"4"],[^"7"].

## Implementation
Any CBAM must be compatible with the [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)](https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/gatt47_e.htm), which sets rules regarding international trade to prevent abusive trade practices but allows exceptions if a measure is temporary, necessary to protect human, animal, plant life, or health, and is not more trade-restrictive than necessary to achieve these aims [^"6"]. Alignment with international trade rules is complex and would require expertise in the field.

Developing countries may see CBAM certification as a barrier to market access. In this instance, exemptions, support mechanisms, or recycling CBAM revenue into green aid could be used. Other countries may impose retaliatory tariffs, thus affecting trade relations.

Average embedded carbon emission values for sectors (e.g., fertilizer, steel) in different countries can provide a baseline average that can be applied to imported goods. This simplification presents the problem of inaccurate import prices. Countries or companies could complete their own assessments and have these measurements independently verified as an alternative to default values. The data gathered from these verified observations could then be used to refine default values [^"2"].
