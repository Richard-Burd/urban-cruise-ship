## Description


We recommend world governments with greenhouse reduction policies implement Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms (BCAMs) to equalize carbon pricing between foriegn and domestic goods.




## Background


Policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions can put domestic manufacturing at a disadvantage compared to companies that produce and import products abroad in countries with less stringent policies. 
Companies may also move production out of the country in order to stay competitive. The effect, known as carbon leakage, is that of a country that reduces its own emissions but transfers those emissions elsewhere in the world. [^"1"]




There are both direct and indirect sources of carbon leakage.
- Direct occurs due to the relocation of production to foreign countries due to climate policies. As a result, domestic entities lose market share, and foreign producers benefit. [^"5"]
- Indirect refers to what will happen as the demand for fossil fuels decrease, and fuels are made less expensive on the global market.  [^"5"]


Carbon border adjustments, also known as Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAM) apply fees on imported goods based on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions created in their production. Depending on the country, these adjustments could also apply rebates to goods produced with high emission standards. [^"3"]


The EU has begun implementation of a CBAM, and is set to begin rollout implementation in October of 2023. It will focus on the sectors with the highest risks of carbon leakage, such as cement, steel, electricity, and hydrogen. [^"4"]


## Implementation

Average values for sectors (e.g., fertilizer, steel) in different countries can provide a baseline. This simplification presents the problem of inaccurate import prices. Countries could complete their own assessments and have these measurements independently verified as an alternative to default values. The data gathered from these verified observations can then be used to refine default values. [^"2"]

Any CBAM must be compatible with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which sets out rules regarding international trade in order to prevent abusive trade practices, but allows for exceptions if a measure is temporary, necessary to protect human, animal, plant life or health, and is not more trade-restrictive than necessary to achieve these aims.
