## Description


We recommend world governments with greenhouse gas reduction policies implement border adjustments, such as the Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms (BCAM), to equalize carbon pricing between foriegn and domestic goods.


## Background


Policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions can put domestic manufacturing at a disadvantage compared to companies that produce and import products abroad in countries with less stringent policies. Companies may also move production out of the country in order to stay competitive. The effect, known as carbon leakage, is that of a country that reduces its own emissions but transfers those emissions elsewhere in the world [^"1"].

In addition to stringent emissions reduction policies leading to offshoring of industry (direct leakage), additional indirect leakage may occur when fossil fuel reduction in one country lowers the world price and stimulates consumption in another country [^"5"]. A border adjustment aims primarily at direct leakage.

Carbon border adjustments, such as Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAM), apply fees on imported goods based on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions created in their production. Depending on the country, these adjustments could also apply rebates to goods produced with high emission standards [^"3"],

The EU began implementation of a CBAM in October 2023, with focus on the sectors with the highest risks of carbon leakage, such as cement, steel, electricity, and hydrogen [^"4"].

## Implementation

Average embedded carbon emission values for sectors (e.g., fertilizer, steel) in different countries can provide a baseline average that can be applied to imported goods. This simplification presents the problem of inaccurate import prices. Countries or companies could complete their own assessments and have these measurements independently verified as an alternative to default values. The data gathered from these verified observations could then be used to refine default values [^"2"].

Any CBAM must be compatible with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which sets rules regarding international trade to prevent abusive trade practices but allows exceptions if a measure is temporary, necessary to protect human, animal, plant life, or health, and is not more trade-restrictive than necessary to achieve these aims [^"6"].
