## Description

We propose that states and the federal government make greater investments into wildlife corridors. The modeled proposal is 21,458 new corridors, the lower bound of the number needed to eliminate 97% of collision costs.

## Background

As of 2008 and over 4 million miles of road, wildlife collisions are estimated to cause 26,000 injuries, 200 fatalities, and almost $9.8 billion (2020 dollars) of damage annually [^"16"]. A combination of fencing and wildlife overpasses or underpasses could reduce these damages by 97% [^"1"].

## Costs

The cost of wildlife corridors is estimated at $500,000 to $2.7 million for an underpass and $2.7-6.2 million for an overpass [^"3"]. On an annual basis at a 5% discount rate, the costs are $25,000 to $135,000 for an underpass and $135,000 to $310,000 for an overpass. Taking the midpoint of the overpass range and applying to our full scenario, the annual cost is estimated at $4.8 billion.

## Benefits

The annual benefits, in terms of avoiding damages from vehicle-wildlife collisions, are estimated at $235,000 to 443,000. Over a 30 year project lifetime and a 7% discount rate, the total benefit from collision reduction is valued at $6,556,500 to $12,359,700 [^"3"].

We estimate the ecosystem service benefits to be about $2.1 million for an underpass and $2.5 million for an overpass. These estimates are based on the ecosystem preservations benefits estimated by Sijtsma et al. [^"4"] (see Table 2), monetized with the value of grassland/rangeland [^"5"], the most common terrestrial biome, at a 2% discount rate [^"6"] over a 30 year lifespan.

For the full scenario, we estimate the collision damage reduction to be valued at $5.0 to $9.5 billion. The ecosystem service benefit is estimated at $2.0 to 2.3 billion.

## Implementation

The exact ideal parameters for wildlife corridors are highly dependent on specific geography and can be difficult to calculate [^"31"], but generally wildlife overpasses or underpasses work better than odors, ultrasound, or lighting [^"2"]. The ideal size of a corridor varies by species but is often about 20 meters, with smaller culverts for small animals also appropriate [^"2"]. Corridors should be accompanied by roadside fences to keep wildlife away from the road.

Federal [^"17"] and state [^"19"] legislation is designed to set standards and provide funding for wildlife corridors.

The Wildlife Corridors Conservation Act, passed by the U.S. House as part of the INVEST in America Act in 2021 [^"7"] and enacted under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Bipartisan Infrastructure Act) [^"8"], includes $400 million in federal grant money for solutions to reduce vehicle-wildlife collisions, and other provisions. Additionally, several states have funded collection of data on wildlife movement, so that they can fund corridors in the most strategic locations [^"8"].
