## Description

Today there are several inert anodes in use in aluminum foundries. We propose that the industry accelerate their use. [^"4"]

## Background

Aluminum demand is expected to increase by over 50% between now and 2050. [^"3"] Currently aluminum production generates 1.1 billion tonnes of CO2 annually, making up 2% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. [^"3"] Part of the problem is with the electricity, often generated by fossil fuels, that is used in production. However, even with clean energy providing the power needed, the smelting process is emission-intensive, accounting for over a quarter of emissions from the sector. [^"1"] 

To produce aluminum, the ore is processed into alumina, which is then reduced into aluminum by electrolysis. Alumina contains oxygen that must be freed in order to be made into Aluminum. When carbon anodes are used, the reaction consumes 400 kg of carbon anodes per ton of aluminum. [^"6"] This process also causes the release of perfluorochemicals (PFCs) such as CF4 which are 7,380 times worse for the climate than CO2, and remain in the atmosphere for 50,000 years [^"7"].  It also releases oxygen from the Alumina. By using inert anodes instead, the process would release only oxygen. [^"1"] 

Replacing the carbon anodes normally used with the electrolysis process with inert anodes eliminates CO2 and PFC emissions. [^"1"] However, the inert anodes require a larger amount of electricity, 9.03kWh/kg versus 5.99kWh/kg for carbon anodes. [^"1"] This is due in part to inert anodes being unable to utilize the chemical energy found within carbon anodes, and it also highlights the necessity for this technology to be paired with a low-emissions energy source. There is no decrease in emissions if the extra energy required is from carbon-intensive sources. [^"5"]

## Implementation

A move to using inert anodes for the smelting process must be coupled with a transition to low-carbon energy. 

This technology is already being used in some new plants, and further deployment is planned. [^"2"]
