## Description

We propose an international agreement to end the manufacture and trade of carbon anodes for aluminum production once an inert anode has been demonstrated to be commercially viable.

## Background

The Hall-Héroult process, invented independently by American Charles Hall and Frenchman Paul Héroult in 1886, transformed aluminum from a niche product into one of the most widespread industrial commodities [^"13"]. The process remains in common usage today. World aluminum producted exceeded 70 million tons in 2023 [^"9"] and is projected to exceed 107 million tons in 2050 [^"14"], which much growth driven by demand for aluminum from solar panels and electric vehicles [^"15"].

As of 2022, the average aluminum produced worldwide had a carbon intensity of the equivalent of 15.1 tons of carbon dioxide [^"12"], or about 1.1 billion tons total. Substantial international variation in emissions intensity [^"3"] is driven by variation in the carbon intensity of electric grids, as electrolysis comprises just over half of the sector's emissions [^"9"]. A source of emissions is the use of carbon anodes to drive electrolysis; electrolysis splits oxygen from aluminum in alumina, which promply reacts with the carbon to produce CO<sub>2</sub> [^"4"]. Additional perfluorochemicals, especially CF<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, are generated from the cryolite electrolyte (Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>) in a phenomenon known as the "anode effect" [^"6"]; these PFCs are highly potent greenhouse gases. The use of an inert, as opposed to carbon, anode would solve both of these problems [^"6"].

Inert anodes are discussed together with another potential technological breakthrough: wettable cathodes [^"7"]. Research and development is ongoing; the most promising wettable cathode material is a titanium diboride composite [^"16"]. A wettable cathode would reduce the energy required for aluminum smelting by allowing lower amperage and potentially enable alternative processes to Hall-Héroult [^"7"].

The theoretical minimum energy for aluminum electrolysis has been estimated at 9.03 kilowatt-hours/kg for inert anodes and 5.99 kWh/kg for carbon anodes [^"1"]; the lesser energy for a carbon anode reaction is due to the exothermic carbon-oxygen reaction, and the greenhouse gas savings of avoiding process reactions with an inert anode could be negated by the upstream emissions of electrolysis if the electricity is derived from carbon-intensive sources [^"5"]. However, actual aluminum energy production is well above either theoretical minimum, and most sources [^"11"] indicate that in practice, an inert anode / wettable cathode combination will save energy.

Efforts to develop an inert anode can be traced to Charles Hall himself [^"2"], but this has long been a difficult research and development problem. As of 2024, the leading develpers of inert anodes are Elysis [^"17"]--a consortium of Alcoa and Rio Tinto--and the Russian aluminum smelter UC Rusal [^"18"].

## Calculations

It is difficult to estimate the cost of retrofitting aluminum smelters with inert anodes, or construction new plants with inert anodes, given that the technology is not yet mainstream. For these calculations, we use an estimate that the cost of retrofitting is $1 to $2 million per electrolysis cell [^"4"] (~2010 dollars). Each cell produces 2-4 tons of aluminum per day [^"8"]. We apply this cost to 70 million tons of aluminum produced worldwide per year as of 2023 [^"9"] and annualize the cost at a 7% discount rate.

It is likewise difficult to estimate the financial impact of inert anode production rather than carbon anode production on operating costs. Estimates of operating cost savings include 3% [^"4"], 10% [^"10"], and 15% [^"11"], though none of these estimates are based on significant operating experience. We use a savings value of 3% for these calculations.

As of 2022, the greenhouse gas intensity of aluminum production was estimated to include 0.8 tons CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent perfluorocarbon, 1.5 tons of process emissions in electrolysis, and 0.1 tons of process emissions in anode manufacturing [^"12"]. We assume that these emissions are eliminated with inert anodes, and that other emissions associated with aluminum production are not affected.

Inert anodes and wettable cathodes together may reduce the electricity demands of electrolysis by up to 25% [^"11"], thereby saving upstream emissions, but this effect is not modeled in our calculations.

We furthermore estimate that without an energy efficiency or operational cost effect of inert anodes, a carbon valuation of about $60 per ton would be necessary to justify inert anode deployment, and without any carbon valuation, inert anodes would need to reduce operating costs by about 6%.

## Implementation

Charles Kenny of the Center for Gloabl Development [^"19"] proposes an approach to aluminum that is modeled after the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the World Maritime Organization's efforts at emission pricing for international shipping, and other sectoral international agreements. The proposal would, upon demonstration of the feasibility of an inert anode, institute import restrictions on carbon anodes. Depending on how the economics of inert anodes develop, such an agreement may hasten a transition to inert anodes that would be driven by market forces, or it may force a transition that would otherwise not occur.

Inert anodes and wettable cathodes are two among many innovations that would address emissions in the aluminum industry; others include the chloride process as an alternative to Hall-Héroult [^"20"] and expanded aluminum recycling [^"21"].
