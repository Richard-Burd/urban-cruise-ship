## Description
We promote the practice of demand response where consumers reduce or shift their electricity usage during peak periods in response to time-based rates or other forms of financial incentives.

## Background
Although not a full substitute for other strategies, demand response is potentially a cost-effective tool to achieve load balancing.

The average potential in studies that consider all sectors is about 23 GW, however this may be high as those studies only present the maximum potential and do not consider temporal availability in detail[^”1”].

## Calculations
The demand response potentials in all consumer sectors add up to a minimum load reduction of 61 GW and a minimum load increase of 68 GW, available in every hour of the year[^”2”].

## Implementation
Electric system planners and operators will need to research and decide what form of demand response is best for their location. This may need to be changed by the season. An educational information ad campaign could be very helpful to inform consumers of their role and to get the most benefit from the programs.
