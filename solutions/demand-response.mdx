## Description
We proposed expanded demand response, whereby consumers reduce or shift their electricity usage during peak periods in response to time-based rates or other financial incentives.

## Background
Although not a full substitute for other strategies, demand response is potentially a cost-effective tool to achieve load balancing. In Germany, the average potential in studies that consider all sectors is about 23 gigawatts, however this may be high as those studies only present the maximum potential and do not consider temporal availability in detail [^"1"]. Worldwide, the International Energy Agency's Net Zero scenario envisions 500 GW of demand response by 2030, compared to 40 GW that were deployed as of 2020 [^"3"].

## Calculations
Across 40 European countries, across all hours of the year, the available load reduction is at least 61 GW, and the load increase is at least 68 GW [^"2"].

## Implementation
Rising penetration of electric vehicles creates and the development of blockchain and Internet of Things technology create the possibility for greater usage of demand response [^"4"]. Most commonly, demand response programs feature a predetermined price of electricity that varies by time of day, but more sophisticated demand response programs feature dynamic electricity pricing that is based on current market conditions [^"4"]. In addition to electric vehicles, heating and cooling, as well as domestic hot water, are found to be cost-effective demand response sectors [^"5"].
