## Description

## Background
Although not a full substitute for other strategies, demand response is potentially a cost-effective tool to achieve load balancing.

The average potential in studies that consider all sectors is about 23 GW, however this may be high as those studies only present the maximum potential and do not consider temporal availability in detail[^”1”].

## Calculations
The demand response potentials in all consumer sectors add up to a minimum load reduction of 61 GW and a minimum load increase of 68 GW, available in every hour of the year[^”2”].

## Implementation
