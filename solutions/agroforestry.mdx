## Description
The U.S. Department of Agriculture should create a database of successful agroforestry methods and disseminate the techniques through education outreach, promoting agroforestry world-wide where it would have the greatest impacts.

## Background
Industrial agriculture, particularly in the U.S., is heavily reliant on monocropping, the practice of growing a single crop species over a large area. This system dominates food production due to its short-term efficiency and mechanization benefits. However, monocropping has significant environmental and economic drawbacks, including:  
Soil Degradation – Continuous cropping of the same species depletes soil nutrients, leading to lower fertility and increased reliance on synthetic fertilizers[^”5”].  
Pest Vulnerability – Large monocultures create ideal conditions for pest outbreaks, necessitating heavy pesticide use that can harm biodiversity and human health[^”5”].  
Water and Chemical Runoff – Increased reliance on irrigation and agrochemicals leads to water pollution and eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems[^”5”].  
Reduced Biodiversity – Monocropping eliminates habitat diversity, threatening pollinators and beneficial organisms essential for ecosystem health[^”4”].

Agroforestry integrates trees, crops, and livestock in ways that enhance productivity and sustainability. The approach mimics natural ecosystems. Benefits of agroforestry include: carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, soil enrichment, and air and water quality[^”2”].
Agroforestry is estimated to be practiced on over 1 billion hectares in developing countries[^”1”].
Substantial areas of unproductive crop, grass, and forest lands as well as degraded lands could be turned to agroforestry[^”3”].

## Calculations
Costs would include research, data collection, and system development, hiring and training agroforestry specialists, and funding educational outreach programs.
Carbon stored in agroforestry systems range from 0.29 to 15.21 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1 aboveground, and 30 to 300 Mg C ha− 1 up to 1-m depth in the soil[^”1”]. Sequestering 2–5 metric tons of CO₂ per hectare annually[^”1”],[^”2”].
Agroforestry systems can reduce fertilizer dependency and decrease runoff[^”6”] and increase farmer income[^”7”].

## Implementation
The [USDA]( https://www.usda.gov/) would be the lead agency for database creation and domestic promotion. [Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)]( https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/) could offer agroforestry grants and technical support. [United Nations Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO)]( https://www.fao.org/home/en) would handle global collaboration for international outreach. [World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF)]( https://www.cgiar.org/research/center/world-agroforestry-centre/) could provide expertise on agroforestry systems and their benefits.

Farmers may be hesitant to transition without financial incentives or clear economic benefits. In some regions, insecure land rights may prevent long-term agroforestry investment.

The extent of carbon sequestered in agroforestry systems depends to a great extent on environmental conditions and system management[^”1”]. Agroforestry techniques must be tailored to local conditions, requiring region-specific research.
