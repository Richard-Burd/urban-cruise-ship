## Description
The U.S. Department of Agriculture should create a database of successful agriforestry methods and disseminate the techniques through education outreach, promoting agroforestry where it would have the greatest impacts.

## Background
Agroforestry is estimated to be practiced on over 1 billion hectares in developing countries[^”1”].

Benefits of agroforestry include: carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, soil enrichment, and air and water quality[^”2”].

Substantial areas of unproductive crop, grass, and forest lands as well as degraded lands could be turned to agroforestry[^”3”].

## Calculations
 Carbon stored in agroforestry systems range from 0.29 to 15.21 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1 aboveground, and 30 to 300 Mg C ha− 1 up to 1-m depth in the soil[^”1”].


## Implementation
The extent of carbon sequestered in agroforestry systems depends to a great extent on environmental conditions and system management[^”1”].
