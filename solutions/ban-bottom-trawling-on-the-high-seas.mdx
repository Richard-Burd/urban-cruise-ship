## Description
We recommend the United Nations ban all bottom trawling in the high seas.

## Background 
Bottom trawling is a fishing practice that involves dragging heavy nets across the seafloor, causing significant damage to marine ecosystems. Some of those damages include the following:  
•	Habitat Destruction: Bottom trawling devastates deep-sea ecosystems, particularly slow-growing coral reefs and sponge fields that can take centuries to recover.  
•	Bycatch and Biodiversity Loss: Trawling indiscriminately catches non-target species, including endangered fish, sea turtles, and marine mammals. This disrupts marine food webs and threatens biodiversity.  
•	Carbon Release: Bottom trawling is estimated to release up to 1.47 billion metric tons of CO₂ annually from seabed disturbance[^"2"].

Several nations and territories have banned bottom trawling in their borders, including Palau [^"8"], Venezuela [^"22"], Hong Kong [^"1"], and Sri Lanka [^"36"], and many others have restricted the practice [^"10"]. 

However, there are limited regulations on bottom trawling in deep international waters, such as some restrictions (not a complete ban) in the Antarctic [^"3"].

## Calculations
Cost could include: Legal and administration costs, satellite surveillance and vessel tracking possibly by expanding on a current system like [Global Fishing Watch]( https://globalfishingwatch.org/), patrols and inspections, and development of sustainable alternatives.

Global subsidies to high seas bottom trawl fleets amount to approximately $152 million annually[^"5"]. Constituting about 25% of the total landed value of these fleets, without these subsidies the majority of the world's bottom trawl fleet operating in the high seas would be unprofitable and would need to transition to alternative income sources[^"5"].

With an estimated [Social Cost of Carbon]( https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) set at $141.40 per ton, the reduction of the aforementioned 1.47 billion metric tons of CO₂ caused by bottom trawling[^"2"] would add a benefit of $207.86 billion annually.

## Implementation
Several avenues exist for implementing a bottom trawling ban in the deep sea (outside of any country's exclusive economic zone), including the Law of the Sea Convention and the Fish Stocks Agreement [^"4"]. In the shorter term, a moratorium could be imposed under the United Nations Open-Ended Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, similar to past agreed upon moratoria [^"4"].

The UN could adopt a resolution through the UN General Assembly or negotiate a binding treaty under the [Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)]( https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/legal/pages/unitednationsconventiononthelawofthesea.aspx#:~:text=The%20United%20Nations%20Convention%20on,the%20oceans%20and%20their%20resources.). Regional fisheries management organizations could play a key role in enforcement and oversight. The [International Maritime Organization (IMO)]( https://www.imo.org/) could help regulate vessels violating the ban.

Countries with large high-seas trawl fleets may oppose restrictions and even with a ban some fleets may continue to operate illegally. The vastness of the high-seas would require significant ongoing surveillance resources to ensure compliance.
