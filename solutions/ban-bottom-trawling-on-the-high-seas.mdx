Several nations and territories have banned bottom trawling in their borders, including Palau [^{ "8" }], Venezuela [^{ "22" }], Hong Kong [^{ "1" }], and Sri Lanka [^{ "36" }], and many others have restricted the practice [^{ "10" }]. There are limited regulations on bottom trawling in international waters, such as some restrictions (not a complete ban) in the Antarctic [^{ "3" }].

Several avenues exist for implementing a bottom trawling ban in the deep sea (outside of any country's exclusive economic zone), including the Law of the Sea Convention and the Fish Stocks Agreement [^{ "4" }]. In the shorter term, a moratorium could be imposed under the United Nations Open-Ended Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, similar to past moratoria agreen upon [^{ "4" }].
