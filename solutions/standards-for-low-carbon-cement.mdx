## Description
We propose the following low-carbon cement standards, detailed below under *Implementation*, with the goal of reducing emissions by 30% annually.

## Background
Cement production accounts for 7% of global carbon emissions[^"1"], while low-carbon cement production options have been shown to reduce carbon emissions by 30% [^"3"], [^"4"].


## Calculations
Low-carbon clinker substitutions are estimated to save $1 billion and abate 8% of emissions [^"5"].

Cement production generates 1.6 billion tonnes of CO₂ annually [^"6"], and a 30% reduction target of 48 million tonnes of CO₂ would have a societal benefit of $6.79 billion at a social cost of carbon of $141.4 per ton.

Carbon capture utilization and storage deployments are estimated to cost $55 per ton of CO₂ ($2.6 billion in total), and abate 22% of emissions, with potential for 40% or more [^"5"].

## Implementation

Our proposed standards consist of four elements: first, the establishment of an emissions intensity standard that covers direct and indirect carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions per unit of clinker and mineral additives, using a default, grid-average emissions factor to calculate indirect emissions [^"1"]; second, setting of the standard at an initial stringency marginally lower than the current average emissions intensity to incentivize investment in currently available, cost-effective abatement options [^"1"]; third, tightening of the stringency of the standard annually [^"1"]; and fourth, a price floor and ceiling for credits, with the values for each taking into consideration the cost of abatement options and backstop carbon removal technologies [^"1"].

A low-carbon cement standard is likely to be added as part of a broader climate change policy portfolio [^"1"]. Decarbonizing the sector as a whole would require complementary policies throughout the supply chain [^"1"]. As the benchmark is lowered over time, the standard can help drive innovation by increasing demand for abatement technologies[^"1"]. Even with adoption of these standards, it will likely take the industry about 10 years to fully adopt and implement them [^"5"].

The cement industry will bear the abatement costs, and their equilibrium price will increase slightly [^"2"].
