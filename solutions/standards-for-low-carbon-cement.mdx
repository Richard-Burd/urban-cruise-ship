## Description
We propose the following low-carbon cement standards with the goal of reducing emissions by 30% annually.

•	Establish an emissions intensity standard that covers direct and indirect carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions per unit of clinker and mineral additives, using a default, grid-average emissions factor to calculate indirect emissions[^”1”].

•	Set the standard at an initial stringency marginally lower than the current average emissions intensity to incentivize investment in currently available, cost-effective abatement options[^”1”].

•	Tighten the stringency of the standard annually[^”1”].

•	Include a price floor and ceiling for credits, with the values for each taking into consideration the cost of abatement options and backstop carbon removal technologies[^”1”].

## Background
Cement production accounts for 7% of global carbon emissions[^”1”].

Low-carbon cement production options have been shown to reduce carbon emissions by 30%[^”3”], [^”4”].


## Calculations
Low-carbon clinker substitutions are estimated to save $1 billion, and abate 8% of emissions[^”5”].

Cement production generates 1.6 billion tonnes of CO₂ annually[^”6”], a 30% reduction target of 48 million tonnes of CO₂ would have a societal benefit of $6.79 billion at a social cost of carbon of $141.4 per ton.

Carbon capture utilization and storage deployments are estimated to cost $55 per ton of CO₂ ($2.6 billion in total), and abate 22% of emissions(with potential for 40% or more)[^”5”].

## Implementation
A low-carbon cement standard is likely to be added as part of a broader climate change policy portfolio[^”1”]. Decarbonizing the sector as a whole would require complementary policies throughout the supply chain[^”1”]. As the benchmark is lowered over time, the standard can help drive innovation by increasing demand for abatement technologies[^”1”]. Even with adoption of these standards, it will likely take the industry about 10 years to fully adopt and implement them[^”5”].

The cement industry will bear the abatement costs, and their equilibrium price will increase slightly[^”2”].
