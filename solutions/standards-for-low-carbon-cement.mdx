## Description
•	Establish an emissions intensity standard that covers direct and indirect carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions per unit of clinker and mineral additives, using a default, grid-average emissions factor to calculate indirect emissions[^”1”].
•	Set the standard at an initial stringency marginally lower than the current average emissions intensity to incentivize investment in currently available, cost-effective abatement options[^”1”].
•	Tighten the stringency of the standard annually[^”1”].
•	Include a price floor and ceiling for credits, with the values for each taking into consideration the cost of abatement options and backstop carbon removal technologies[^”1”].

## Background
Cement production accounts for 7% of global carbon emissions[^”1”].

Low carbon cement production options have been shown to reduce carbon emissions by 30%[^”3”], [^”4”].


## Calculations


## Implementation
A low-carbon cement standard is likely to be added as part of a broader climate change policy portfolio[^”1”].

Decarbonizing the sector as a whole would require complementary policies throughout the supply chain[^”1”].

As the benchmark is lowered over time, the standard can help drive innovation by increasing demand for abatement technologies[^”1”].

The cement industry will bear the abatement costs, and their equilibrium price will increase slightly[^”2”].
