## Background

Nuclear power is struggling despite its ability to provide baseload, low-carbon power, and small modular reactors are one tool to try to revitalize the industry. SMRs will most likely be more expensive that conventional nuclear power initially, due to a diseconomy of scale that follows from the smaller size [^"8"]. However, it is hoped that modularity and simplification of design will eventually allow SMR, even using the same light water technology as most nuclear power on the world market today, to achieve a lower price point [^"10"]. To reach this point will almost certainly require some public support.

There are currently over 50 small modular reactor concepts under development [^"1"]. SMR has been envisioned as miniature versions of the light water reactors that are common today, and also as using novel technologies, such as gas cooled reactors, liquid metal cooled reactors, and molten salt reactors [^”4”]. There is thus considerable overlap between small modular reactors and advanced reactors.

SMRs may replace diesel generators in renewable based micro-grids that need a dependable and stable power production to make up for the fluctuations in renewable production [^"3"], and they likewise may be suitable for island grids which cannot supoprt a full-scale nuclear power plant [^"6"]. SMRs can also provide industrial process heat [^"7"].

Current R&D needs include regulatory and licensing frameworks, studies on deploying SMR into predominately renewable energy grids, technology readiness assessments, establishing supply chains, and in general infrastructure, safety, and security [^”5”].

## Calculations

We estimate the annual cost of an SMR research program to be the same $460 million as the annual cost of an advanced reactor research program, as shown below, though we model a 10 year research period rather than 25 years.

For benefit, we assume that SMR electricity would cost 9¢/kWh, as in our levelized cost analysis above, would entail lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of 57 grams per kilowatt-hour, valued 0.285¢/kWh with carbon dioxide valued at $50/ton, and would have 0.31¢/kWh of other externalities. These figures are as above, but we assume zero cost for meltdown risk from SMR. See our analysis of [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) for more information.

## Implementation

The development of small modular reactors has been plagued by setbacks. In 2023, the most developed SMR project at the time was cancelled. The project was a joint venture between the Oregon-based company NuScale and the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS), backed by the U.S. Department of Energy with a $1.4 billion multi-year grant in 2021 [^"12"]. Despite DOE funding, project costs had escalated, and UAMPS was not able to attract enough customers for the power that NuScale was to produce [^"8"].

Under any likely scenario, SMR will be commercialized by private companies with help from the U.S. Department of Energy. To that end, the DoE should continue with the Advanced Small Modular Reactors program [^"11"].

As discussed below, broader regulatory and industry reforms are needed before small modular reactors, or any kind of new nuclear power, is commercially viable [^"9"]. Although these benefits are not modeled in the above figures, SMR may be most likely to succeed if its initial markets target niches that are not easily filled by other options, such as industrial heat [^"7"] or island grids [^"6"].

International collaborative frameworks will need to be developed before there is large scale deployment of SMRs [^"1"]. Developing countries that want to invest in nuclear power are required to develop regulations on waste management and hold insurance arrangements with surrounding countries [^"2"]. SMR reactors are a good fit to fill this need for these emerging countries.
