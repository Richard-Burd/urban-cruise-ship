We estimate that a concerted effort on the part of the Department of Energy to commercialize small modular reactors would cost $4.6 billion and have about an expected $60 billion in benefit.

As SMR is closer to commercial viability than advanced reactors, we assume a 10 year research period, as opposed to the 25 year period for advanced reactors. We estimate the annual cost of an SMR research program to be the same $460 million as the annual cost of an advanced reactor research program, as shown below.

For benefit, we assume that SMR electricity would cost 9¢/kWh, as in our levelized cost analysis above, would emit 0.285¢/kWh of greenhouse gases, and would have 0.31¢/kWh of other externalities. These figures are as above, but we assume zero cost for meltdown risk from SMR. See our analysis of [research and development](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/rd) for more information.
