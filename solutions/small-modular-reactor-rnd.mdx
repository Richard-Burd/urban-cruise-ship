## Description
We propose the research, development, and commercialization of small modular reactors (SMR).

## Background
As SMR is closer to commercial viability than advanced reactors, we assume a 10 year research period, as opposed to the 25 year period for advanced reactors. There are currently over 50 concepts under development [^"1"].

Utilities can use SMRs to diversify their portfolio of power plants and technologies, creating resilience and dependability [^"2"]. SMRs are economically competitive within the 1-3 gigawatt-electric range [^"2"].

SMRs can also be used to replace diesel generators in renewable based micro-grids that need a dependable and stable power production to make up for the fluctuations in renewable production [^"3"]. SMRs can also provide industrial process heat [^"3"].

There are a variety of SMR designs: light water reactors, gas cooled reactors, liquid metal cooled reactors, and molten salt reactors[^”4”].

Current R&D needs include: regulatory and licensing frameworks, studies on deploying SMR into predominately renewable energy grids, technology readiness assessments, establishing supply chains, and in general infrastructure, safety, and security[^”5”].

## Calculations
We estimate the annual cost of an SMR research program to be the same $460 million as the annual cost of an advanced reactor research program, as shown below.
For benefit, we assume that SMR electricity would cost 9¢/kWh, as in our levelized cost analysis above, would entail lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions valued 0.285¢/kWh with carbon dioxide valued at $50/ton, and would have 0.31¢/kWh of other externalities. These figures are as above, but we assume zero cost for meltdown risk from SMR. See our analysis of research and development for more information.

## Implementation
SMR will be commercialized by private companies with help from the Department of Energy.

International collaborative frameworks will need to be developed before there is large scale deployment of SMRs [^"1"]. Developing countries that want to invest in nuclear power, are required to develop regulations on waste management and hold insurance arrangements with surrounding countries [^"2"]. SMR reactors are a good fit to fill this need for these emerging countries.
