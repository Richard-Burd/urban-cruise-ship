The externalized damage from coal ash has been estimated at about 1/10 of a cent per kilowatt-hour [^"7"], similar to the 1/10 cent/kWh levy that is assessed on nuclear power plants for waste disposal [^"8"].

The proceeds of the fee would go to a dedicated fund that finances remediation of coal ash disposal sites, similar to how the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund finances reclamation of coal refuse [^"2"]. The fund would be administered by the U. S. EPA.
