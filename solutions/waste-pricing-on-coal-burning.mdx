## Description

We propose a levy on coal burning to account for environmental damages.

## Background

Coal-fired power generates around 10,400 TWh of electricity annually[^”1”].

## Calculations

The externalized damage from coal ash has been estimated at about 1/10 of a cent per kilowatt-hour[^”2”], similar to the 1/10 cent/kWh levy that is assessed on nuclear power plants for waste disposal[^”3”].
This levy would raise $10.4 billion annually.
We use the average cost of passing state legislation ($13,625,000) [^”4”] and add the average cost of federal regulations ($11,714,286) [^”5”] to come up with a guess as to how much it would cost to enact this levy. Compliance costs are estimated to average $13,142,857 per regulation annually[^”5”]. Together this equals $38,482,143, multiplied by 195 countries equals $7.5 billion.

## Implementation

The proceeds of the fee would go to a dedicated fund that finances remediation of coal ash disposal sites, similar to how the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund finances reclamation of coal refuse[^”6”]. The fund would be administered by the U.S. EPA in the U.S. and similar organizations in other countries.
