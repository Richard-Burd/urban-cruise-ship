## Description
Livestock accounts for 20% of all worldwide GHG emissions [^"1"]. We propose a United States nationwide tax of 33.3% on beef, 11.3% on pork, and 8.9% on chicken to account for the environmental costs of meat production [^"2"].

## Calculations
Using the ratio between the tax rate and the reduction of demand by Springman et al. [^"3"] we assume that our tax rates will lead to a 10.8%, 2.8%, and 3% reduction in beef, pork, and chicken respectively. This would reduce yearly CO₂ emissions from livestock consumption [^"4"] by 145 million tons per year [^"5"].

The revenue from this meat tax would raise approximately $12.6 billion dollars [^"6"].

A meat tax within this range would reduce diet related healthcare costs by 14% [^"7"], or $7 billion out of $50 billion in overall diet-related health costs [^"8"].

We use the average cost of passing state legislature ($272,500)[^"9"] and add the average cost of federal regulations ($13,142,857)[^"10"] to come up with a guess as to how much it would cost to enact this tax. The cost should be very reasonable however there will be annual compliance costs.

We also assume that over time 34.1 million hectares of land will be repurposed from beef production [^"11"].

## Calculations
This may need to come after, or in conjunction with an informational advocacy campaign to gain acceptance from the general public. There will be strong opposition from the meat industry that will need to be countered.
