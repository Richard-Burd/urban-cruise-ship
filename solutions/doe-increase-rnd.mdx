## Background

The United States Department of Energy began operations on October 1, 1977, in the aftermath of the first energy crisis of the 1970s, and consolidated work of the U.S. federal government on nuclear weapons, nuclear power, and other energy programs that were distributed throughout the federal government [^"8"]. The DoE's budget request for Fiscal Year 2024 was nearly $52 billion, of which nearly half was for the National Nuclear Security Administration, which manages nuclear weapons and military uses of nuclear energy [^"9"]. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), most relevant to the proposal discussed here, has a requested budget of $3.83 billion [^"9"].

Within EERE and other federal agencies, clean energy research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) was proposed for $11 billion for FY2024. Total investment is $17 billion when the additional spending of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act are included. However, the RD&D budget would be $32 billion if it was the same share of GDP as in 1978 [^"10"]. We therefore assess that there is a potential for DoE to productively spend another $15 billion per year.

When firms conduct research and development, they generate significant spillover effects that benefits other firms and that is not captured by the firm doing R&D [^"11"]. As discussed below, the social return to R&D has been estimated as between 4:1 and 20:1 [^"13"]. Thus there is a positive externality to research and justification for public support of R&D, either through tax credits or through direct performance of R&D.

## Calculations
To audit the effectiveness of its work, the U.S. Department of Energy has commissioned several independent studies of the costs and benefits of programs of their research portfolio [^"1"]. Our calculations are based on a composite of six of these studies. Costs, benefits, and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction are reported on an undiscounted, annual basis and CPI-adjusted to 2024 unless otherwise noted.

| Technology | Annual Cost | Annual Benefit | Annual CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vehicle Combustion Engine, 1986-2007 [^"2"] | $65 million | $4.9 billion | 8.4 million tons |
| Wind, 1976-2008 [^"3"] | $135 million | $476 million | 2.6 million tons |
| Geothermal, 1980-2008 [^"4"] | $3.6 million | $461 million | 250,000 tons |
| Solar Photovoltaic, 1975-2008 [^"5"] | $164 million | $831 million | 33,000 tons |
| Hybrid and Electric Vehicles, 1999-2022 [^"6"] | $44 million (1999-2012) | $347 million | 483,000 tons |
| HVAC, Water Heating, Appliances, 1976-2029 [^"7"] | $19 million (1976-2015) | $249 million (7% discount rate applied) | N/A |

We mostly report undiscounted cost and benefit figures. The measured benefit-cost ratio is significantly smaller if a large discount rate is used, but all six programs show favorable benefit-cost ratios even at a 7% discount rate. Conversely, benefits may be underestimated because they underestimate benefits beyond the study window. In particular, aside from hybrid and electric vehicles and HVAC, water heating, and appliances, no benefits beyond the study window are estimated at all, and those two only estimate energy savings from devices that are deployed at the end of the study window, without considering future devices that would result from the R&D investments. We suspect that the financial and greenhouse gas benefits of wind and solar research in particular are greatly underestimated for this reason.

All six studies monetize financial benefits--especially in the form of saved energy--and environmental and health benefits, but in all cases, the benefits of greenhouse gas reduction are not monetized and shown separately.

## Implementation

How best to do R&D depends greatly on the area. A balanced research program by the Department of Energy consists of full funding for the national laboratories; ARPA-E for high-risk, high-reward projects; the Energy Frontier Research Centers for basic science; energy innovation hubs for collaboration with industry; and the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation for advances based on manufacturing capacity [^"12"].

It is important for DoE to continually audit the effectiveness of their funding, as they have in the past [^"1"].

We propose a wide range of areas in which to invest. However, some technologies appear to be particularly promising, while some are less so, as we discuss throughout this site.
