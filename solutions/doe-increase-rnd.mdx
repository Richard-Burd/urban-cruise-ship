export const solution = "The Department of Energy Should Increase Energy R&D";

## Description

The Department of Energy should fully fund research and development efforts to insure that every research endeavor, with expected benefit exceeding cost, is funded.

## Implementation

How best to do R&D depends greatly on the area. A balanced research program by the Department of Energy will consist of full funding for the national laboratories, ARPA-E for high-risk, high-reward projects, the Energy Frontier Research Centers for basic science, energy innovation hubs for collaboration with industry, and the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation for advances based on manufacturing capacity [^"12"]
