## Description

We recommend businesses, especially those in the courier and delivery sector, adopt the use of e-bikes for package delivery in high-density areas as a strategy to reduce traffic, reduce pollution, and improve delivery service.

## Calculations

The initial investment for an e-bike fleet includes the purchase of the e-bikes, installation of charging stations, and staff training. However, these costs are offset by savings in fuel and maintenance costs associated with traditional delivery trucks [^"1"]. Companies operating in urban areas can save 45% on delivery costs within urban areas [^"6"].

A study by the University of Washington's Urban Freight Lab [^"5"] found that delivery trucks emit 246 grams of carbon dioxide-equivalent per kilometer, compared to 7 grams with e-bikes [^"5"]. Furthermore, delivery trucks are more likely to fail to deliver the package on the first try, requiring reshipment. While delivery trucks can make more delivery locations per hour than e-bikes, this does not factor in the walking time required by the drivers and potential fines for double parking. E-bikes can get closer to the final destination with their vehicle [^"5"].

The New York City Department of Transportation has found that cargo e-bikes save 7 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per year per bike [^"8"].

E-bikes navigate urban environments more efficiently than trucks, leading to faster delivery times and increased productivity [^"1"]. A study on cargo bike delivery concept selection suggests that renting cargo bikes from a third-party provider is the most cost-effective solution for e-commerce companies [^"2"].

Additional benefits include easy e-bike navigation through traffic jams and across narrow streets, pedestrian zones, and low-emission zones [^"1"], and health benefits from physical activity [^"3"].


## Implementation

Investing in e-bike fleets is more cost-effective in the long run, considering the savings on fuel and maintenance. [^"2"]

While U.S. federal legislation in 2019 allowed e-bikes to travel through public parks, there's a need for more uniform e-bike laws across states [^"9"]. The National Institute for Transportation and Communities advises that devices going faster than 20 miles per hour do not belong in bicycle lanes and shared-use paths, and limiting the speeds of electric bikes in these areas is advised. Presently, each state and municipality in the state can have its own local rules, which results in a confusing patchwork [^"4"].
