## Description

We propose research and development into reducing the cost of building and running concentrated solar power (CSP) plants.

## Background

The Department of Energy has set a goal of bringing the cost of CSP to 5¢/kWh by 2030 [^”2”], bringing the cost in line with photovoltaic (PV) costs today. Unlike PV, CSP can be used directly for low-grade industrial heat or for desalination.

The ultimate cost of concentrated solar is expected to reach 5 ¢/kWh, and we estimate that it will have the same life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and other externalities as solar PV. Based on research done by the Department of Energy [^”1”]. We estimate that a CSP research program will take 10 years to mature, and the cost is the same $830 million per year that a [wave energy](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/mhk) research program would require. See our [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) analysis for more information.

## Implementation

Key areas of research include improving the efficiency and reducing the cost of the collector field and improving the performance of the power block, particularly by substituting the steam Rankine cycle with a supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle [^”3”].

Thermal energy storage systems improve CSP efficiency and dependability and are installed on more than 70% of new CSP plants [^”4”].
