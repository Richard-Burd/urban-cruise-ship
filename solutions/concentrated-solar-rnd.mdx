## Description
We promote research and development into reducing the cost of building and running concentrated solar power plants.

## Calculations
The ultimate cost of concentrated solar is estimated to reach 5 ¢/kWh, and we estimate that it will have the same life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and other externalities to conventional solar. Based on research done by the Department of Energy[^”1”]. We estimate that a CSP research program will take 10 years to maturate, and the cost is the same $830 million per year that a [wave energy](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/mhk) research program would require. See our [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) analysis for more information.

## Implementation
The Department of Energy has set a goal of bringing the cost of CSP to 5¢/kWh by 2030[^”2”], bringing the cost in line with photovoltaic costs today. CSP has the advantage that it can be used directly for low-grade industrial heat or desalination.
Keys areas of research include improving the efficiency and reducing the cost of the collector field and improving the performance of the power block, particularly by substituting the steam Rankine cycle with a supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle[^”3”].
