## Description

## Background

Despite the slowdown of interest, the levelized cost of CSP has fallen by more than two thirds from 38¢ per kilowatt-hour in 2010 to 11.8¢/kWh in 2022 [^"6"]. Even the reduced price, however, is too expensive for CSP to stand on its own commercially. The Department of Energy has set a goal of bringing the cost of CSP to 5¢/kWh by 2030 [^”2”], in line with photovoltaics (PV) today.

Unlike PV, CSP can be used directly for low-grade heat for industrial applications, including water desalination, enhanced oil recovery, food processing, mineral processing, and applications in the chemicals industry [^"7"].

To achieve stable production, CSP may have to augment solar power with natural gas. In 2014, the Ivanpah concentrated solar power facility in California emited 46 thousands tons of CO<sub>2</sub> from burning gas [^"11"], which gave the plant emissions of 110 grams CO<sub>2</sub> per kilotwatt-hour from burning gas [^"8"], [^"9"], [^"10"]. This contrasts to about 460 g/kWh from a natural gas plant.

## Calculations

Based on research done by the Department of Energy [^"7"], the ultimate cost of concentrated solar is expected to reach 5 ¢/kWh, and we estimate that it will have the same life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and other externalities as solar PV. We estimate that a CSP research program will take 10 years to mature, and the cost is the same $830 million per year that a [wave energy](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/mhk) research program would require. See our [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) analysis for more information.

## Implementation

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has identified several operational problems with the small number of CSP plants operating in the United States, particularly a failure to adequately plan for maintenance and operational challenges [^"5"]. Site selection, which requires effective monitoring of the solar resource and other factors, has often been poor [^"5"]. Additional needed areas of research include improving the efficiency and reducing the cost of the collector field and improving the performance of the power block, particularly by substituting the steam Rankine cycle with a supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle [^”3”].

It is common for CSP plants to warm up with natural gas, though storage obviates this need [^"12"]. Thermal energy storage systems improve CSP efficiency and dependability and are installed on more than 70% of new CSP plants [^”4”], and this is necessary for CSP to be a reliable, low-carbon energy source.
