## Description
We promote research into concentrating PV.

## Background
Concentrating PV systems offer various advantages over flat panel devices. These include: higher electrical conversion efficiency, smaller use of space, ease of recycling constituent materials, and less toxic materials used in the production process[^”1”]. Currently the use of concentrating systems is limited in scale and deploys devices that are considerable in size[^”1”].
Concentrating PV technology may also be ideal for use in greenhouses[^”2”].

## Calculations
We estimate the expected benefit of a concentrated PV research program to be about $54 billion and the cost to be about $4 billion over a five year period. As the technology has already been commercialized on a limited scale, we estimate that only five years of research would be required, and the cost is estimated to be the same $830 million annually as a [wave energy](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/mhk) research program. We estimate the final price of such a research program to be 7 ¢/kWh, with the same greenhouse gas and other external costs as other forms of solar. See our [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) analysis for more details.

## Implementation
The viability of concentrating PV systems is dependent on their ability to offer a comparative economic advantage over flat panels, whose market prices are decreasing making it harder for concentrating PV to gain a foothold[^”1”]. Currently there are more than 30 companies developing concentrating PV systems. While most of these companies are still in the start-up phase, there is potential for a rapid increase in production[^”1”].
Another issue with concentrating PV is higher cell temperatures. However there is potential for thermal energy recovery and reuse turning this extra heat into a pathway to improve concentrating PV performance[^”3”].
