## Description
We promote research into concentrating PV.

## Background
Interest in concentrating PV has diminished in recent years, however the technology may be ideal for use in greenhouses[^”1”], insuring that it remains an important part of the solar energy portfolio.

## Calculations
We estimate the expected benefit of a concentrated PV research program to be about $54 billion and the cost to be about $4 billion over a five year period. As the technology has already been commercialized on a limited scale, we estimate that only five years of research would be required, and the cost is estimated to be the same $830 million annually as a [wave energy](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/mhk) research program. We estimate the final price of such a research program to be 7 ¢/kWh, with the same greenhouse gas and other external costs as other forms of solar. See our [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) analysis for more details.
