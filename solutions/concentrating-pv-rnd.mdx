We estimate the expected benefit of a concentrated PV research program to be about $54 billion and the cost to be about $4 billion. As the technology has already been commercialized on a limited scale, we estimate that only five years of research would be required, and the cost is estimated to be the same $830 million annually as a [wave energy](http://urbancruiseship.org/solution/energy/mhk) research program. We estimate the final price of such a research program to be 7 Â¢/kWh, with the same greenhouse gas and other external costs as other forms of solar. See our [research and development](/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) analysis for more details.

Interesting in concentrating PV has dimishined somewhat in recent years, but the technology may be ideal for use in greenhouses [^"24"], insuring that it remains an important part of the solar energy portfolio.
