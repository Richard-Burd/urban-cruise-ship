## Background

Serious research interest in CPV began in the wake of the 1970s oil crisis, when there was great interest around the world in developing alternative energy sources. At that time, silicon solar panels were far too expensive to be a mainstream energy source, and so it was hoped that the cost of a PV system could be reduced by concentrating sunlight and reducing the volume of PV cells that would be required to generate power [^"4"].

Interest in CPV waned after the oil price drop in the 1980s and then after the fall of crystalline silicon (c-Si) prices in the late 2000s. In the early 2010s, CPV experienced a revival of interest as new III-V cells and multijunction cells, which had previously seen most of their application restricted to spacecraft, became financially feasible. While these cells are much more expensive than c-Si, the smaller quantity needed as a result of concentration looked feasible, and CPV with advanced cells offers a clear efficiency advantage over conventional flat-panel c-Si. However, by the mid-2010s, interest in CPV collapsed again, and by the end of the decade, commercial activity nearly ceased [^"5"].

Advantages of CPV systems over conventional PV include higher electrical conversion efficiency, better land efficiency, ease of recycling constituent materials, and fewer toxic materials in the production process [^”1”]. Currently the use of concentrating systems is limited in scale and deploys large devices [^”1”]. CPV technology may also be ideal for greenhouses [^”2”].

However, the complexity associated with CPV has so far proven to be an insurmountable barrier. Complexity comes in two forms: because a CPV system needs direct sunlight, commercial CPV deployments require 2-axis tracking systems, and because cells are subjected to concentrations of multiple hundreds of suns, cooling systems for the panels are required. Costs resulting from complexity have negated the theoretical cost and land savings from greater efficiency [^"6"].

## Calculations
We estimate the expected benefit of a concentrated PV research program to be about $54 billion and the cost to be about $4 billion over a five year period. As the technology has already been commercialized on a limited scale, we estimate that five years of research would be required, and the cost is estimated to be the same $830 million annually as a [wave energy](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/mhk) research program. We estimate the final price of such a research program to be 7 ¢/kWh, with the same greenhouse gas and other external costs as other forms of solar. See our [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) analysis for more details.

## Implementation

Analysis in 2014 found that CPV would show a strong learning rate of 18%, achieving great cost reduction by 2020 [^"7"]. However, the analysis was based on an overly optimistic projection of industry development. Despite the past commercial activity, we expect that fundamental research is needed before CPV can again be economically viable.

The geometry of the concentrators is one area for ongoing R&D [^"8"].

The viability of CPV depends on a comparative economic advantage over flat panels, whose market prices are decreasing, making it harder for CPV to gain a foothold [^”1”]. The most like path forward for CPV is to satisfy multiple markets simultaneously. Three such markets are electricity, greenhouse lighting, and low-grade industrial heat for applications such as desalination [^"6"], [^"3"]. It is not likely that CPV will compete directly with c-Si for electricity alone [^"6"].
