At present, hunting licensing fees pay for a large portion of the conservation efforts of most states. With the number of active hunters declining, we propose that states stabilize their conservation programs by financing them through general funds instead. Aside from stability of funding, the system of heavy dependence on hunting permits creates an incentive for states to increase hunting, which works against conservation goals [^"1"].
