Americans lose tens of billions of dollars to congestion every year [^"16"], [^"17"]. The congestion that one driver imposes on others is an external cost that can be internalized through a charge to use roadways, called a congestion price [^"22"].

There are several ways that congestion pricing could be implemented [^"28"].

- Cordon Pricing: A charge is assessed to drive in and/or out of a designated zone, such as in Singapore's Electronic Road Pricing system [^"35"].
- Area Pricing: A per-kilometer charge is assessed to drive in a designated zone.
- Roadway Pricing: A charge is assessed to drive on certain roads or bridges.
- Vehicle-mile fee: A fee is charged for every mile driven.

Proposed prices include $9.18 to drive and out of Manhattan [^"19"], $4 to enter highly congested roads in Los Angeles [^"11"], and $10-12 to drive into downtown San Francisco [^"6"].

The social aspects politics of congestion pricing can be quite challenging. In practice, congestion pricing has been generall regressive [^"29"]. Nevertheless, congestion pricing is usually well accepted once it becomes established [^"29"]. Due to the complexity of a system, tolls must be collected through an electronic system [^"7"].
