## Description

We recommend the International Maritime Organization (IMO), along with other international organizations implement mandatory global shipping noise regulations.

## Background

As discussed in the article, [reducing shipping speeds](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/oceans/ocean_environment/ocean_biodiversity), shipping noise adversely impacts marine life, affecting their behavior, physiology, and reproduction, which in turn affects their mortality rates. [^"1"] While many countries and stakeholders are adopting noise reduction policies, there is yet to be a global standard to address this issue. [^"5"]

Recent Developments:
- International Maritime Organization (IMO): Adopted a regulation in 2012 to require ships to reduce onboard noise and protect personnel from noise, aligning with the Code on noise levels on board ships​. [^"9"]
- European Union (EU): In 2022, the EU adopted thresholds for underwater noise, mandating member states to develop regulations for shipping to ensure compliance with these thresholds​. [^"8"]
- International Organization for Standardization (ISO): Set multiple standards for the maritime industry, including ISO 2923:1996 for on-board noise, and ISO 17208-1:2016 for underwater acoustics​. [^"10"]
- Effective noise management policies are being explored across major noise-generating industries including shipping, with considerations for economic factors and policy options. ​[^"12"]
- Some ports have set regulations or incentive programs to reduce vessel speed and thereby control underwater noise from shipping​. [^"13"]

## Implementation

Global policies to reduce and control shipping noises could be put into place by the IMO.
