## Description
We recommend the United States federal government enhance radon monitoring and outreach within low-income households, providing free testing.

## Background
Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that emanates from the earth's crust. It is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, making it impossible to detect without specialized equipment. When inhaled, radon gas decays into radioactive particles that can become trapped in the lungs, damaging lung tissue over time and potentially leading to lung cancer.[^"3"] The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that radon is responsible for about 21,000 lung cancer deaths annually in the U.S.[^"2"]

Low-income households, both owned and rented, often lack the resources to carry out radon testing and mitigation. Additionally, these demographics may lack awareness of the risks associated with radon exposure and the availability of testing and mitigation resources.[^"4"]

Radon test kits range from $17 to $27 USD each. Treating radon problems in a home can cost upwards of $1,000.[^"6"] There is a patchwork of states that provide free kits to lower income households, as well as loan programs and grants for mitigation[^"8"] [^"9"], however, a federal program could allow everyone in the United States to be able to obtain these kits.

## Calculations
Our calculation strategy is first to estimate the potential scope of expanded testing in terms of disability-adjust life-years (DALYs) saved, and second, to estimate the per-DALY cost and benefit of a program.

It is the goal of the the 2021-2025 National Radon Action Plan [^"7"] to save 3500 lives per year. This is a sixth of the often-quoted 21,000 annual deaths from radon-induced lung cancer in the United States [^"11"], and an ambitious goal that will be challenging to achieve.

Haucke [^"13"] estimates in Germany that expanded testing would mitigate health hazards at a cost of just under $50,000 per DALY, adjusting for currency conversion and inflation. We value a DALY at $100,000 [^"14"].



## Implementation
Work on radon exposure legislation is ongoing. In 2011, The Federal Radon Action Plan was released. The National Radon Action Plan 2021-25 (NRAP) is another initiative to spur testing, awareness, and financing toward radon mitigation and risk reduction. 
Awareness of the risks of radon exposure is still low in low-income households. A public health campaign could help raise awareness and promote testing.[^"4"]
