## Description
We propose using ammonia as a form of long-term seasonal energy storage.

## Background
Ammonia, chemically NH<sub>3</sub>, is of interest for energy storage and many other applications as a carrier of hydrogen [^"1"]. Ammonia does not contain carbon, is not a greenhouse gas, and has narrow flammability in open air [^"1"]. Ammonia is produced with water, air, and electricity, and it is readily stored long-term in storage tanks [^"1"].
Production steps of NH<sub>3</sub> include electrolysis, air separation, and the Haber-Bosch processes for nitrogen fixation, and while the Haber-Bosch process is of significant cost, electrolysis is the most expensive component of the process [^"1"].

## Calculations
The global cost of using ammonia is $328.86 per megawatt-hour [^"1"]. Ammonia's round-trip efficiency for 30-day storage is estimated at 23-33% [^"2"].


## Implementation
There will need to be rigid safety protocols in place as ammonia has significant toxicity by inhalation and is corrosive to several metals, with damage from NOx emissions to steel combustion appliances a particular concern [^"1"].

While there is some partial grid infrastructure for using ammonia as storage in the United States, there is none in Europe or other countries and that will need to be developed for this to be truly viable worldwide [^"1"].
