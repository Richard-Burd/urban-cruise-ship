Increasing Earth's forest cover, whether through reducing deforestation or active afforestation, will sequester carbon, though the exact amount is highly uncertain.

Estimates of the carbon sequstration potential of tree planting vary widely, ranging from 113 [^"22"] to 564 billion tons CO2e [^"1"], or 3-14 years of emissions at present rates. We suspect the true figure is closer to the low estimate of Veldman et al., as it better accounts for practical limitations such as cost, land ownership and land use conflicts, and the loss of planted forests due to human activity or wildfire [^"23"].

At a cost of $20-50 per removed ton of CO2 and a social cost of carbon of $50/ton, there a potential for as much as $3.4 trillion of value in tree planting under Veldman et al.'s more conservative estimate.

Several pieces of legislation introduced in the United States Congress would promote tree planting [^"11"]. General approaches including subsidies for tree planting, modeled after the 45Q program for carbon capture and sequestration or renewable energy production tax credits; and federal funding for tree planting on public lands, modeled after other forms of infrastructure investment [^"11"].
