## Background
Increasing Earth's forest cover, whether through reducing deforestation or active afforestation, will sequester carbon, though the exact amount is highly uncertain. Tree restoration has one of the greatest potentials for carbon sequestration out of any solution or technology, espcially in terms of costs [^"5"].

Estimates of the carbon sequestration potential of tree planting vary widely, ranging from 113 [^"22"] to 564 billion tons CO<sub>2</sub>e [^"1"], or 3-14 years of emissions at present. A study cited in this solution estimates a total of 753.8 billion tons CO<sub>2</sub>e with an uncertainty range of 488 to 1 trillion tons CO<sub>2</sub>e [^"5"]. We suspect the true figure is closer to the low estimate of Veldman et al. of 152.5 gigatons, as it better accounts for practical limitations such as cost, land ownership and land use conflicts, and the loss of planted forests due to human activity or wildfire [^"23"].

Reforestation has been examined as a solution for ground-level ozone abatement. Ground-level ozone is estimated to cause 152,000 deaths per year as of 2014. In addition, it is linked to increased respiratory and cardiovascular disease. It also has been shown to reduce crop productivity. Current abatement techniques have focused on economic incentives and technological solutions to reduce pollutants which are responsible for the formation of ozone. [^"9"].

Based on the US case study, our scenario of 899 million hectares of afforestation could reduce ground-level ozone by 22.21 megatons and NO<sub>x</sub> by 4.29 megatons per year [^"9"]. Using a $64,075 per ton average of health benefits (including decreased mortality and quality of life years) for NO<sub>x</sub> reductions, we estimate $274.88 billion/year benefit based upon long-term benefits with a 7 percent discount rate [^"24"]. However, pending further study, we do not include these into the above metric totals.


## Calculations

We use an average price for per hectare project costs of $6,000 ($2,000 to $10,000 range) [^"12"]. These could involve financial incentives or subsidies for private landowners or projects to restock potential forest areas, which could lower overall costs, as seen in a US study [^"6"]. Benefits are calculated from the social cost of carbon of $141.40 per ton. 

## Implementation
Several pieces of legislation introduced in the United States Congress would promote tree planting [^"11"]. General approaches including subsidies for tree planting, modeled after the 45Q program for carbon capture and sequestration or renewable energy production tax credits; and federal funding for tree planting on public lands, modeled after other forms of infrastructure investment [^"11"]. Carbon pricing may also drive markets towards increased forest cover [^"8"].

While trees have great potential to sequester carbon, it must be coupled with concerns towards biodiversity. Tree restoration could be beneficial to entire ecoysystems, but simply focusing on carbon reductions can lead to monoculture risks or focusing on fast growing trees that will lock up more carbon immediately, but could result in future problems. We believe the goal should be focused around restoration of forests rather than repurposing areas where forests would not normally grow.
