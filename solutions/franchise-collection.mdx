## Description

We propose that cities adopt a franchise system for waste collection, as has worked well in San Jose, California.

## Background

A franchise system in waste collection involves the municipality granting exclusive rights to a private entity or entities for the collection of waste within a specified area. This system aims to optimize waste collection routes, reduce operational costs, and enhance service delivery to residents. The franchisee is typically responsible for adhering to municipal waste management standards, including recycling and composting goals. The competitive nature of franchise systems can result in higher levels of efficiency[^"1"].

Adopting a franchise system can lead to significant improvements in the efficiency of waste collection services. Optimized collection routes and schedules, as identified in studies on urban waste collection optimization, can reduce fuel consumption and vehicle emissions[^"2"].

## Implementation

Municipalities should establish clear criteria for selecting franchisees, including environmental performance, cost efficiency, and community engagement strategies.
