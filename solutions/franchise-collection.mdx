import SolutionDropdown from '/components/SolutionDropdown.js'

export const problem = "Recycling Rates";
export const solution = "Franchise Collection";

We propose that cities adopt a franchise system for waste collection, as has worked well in San Jose, California.

export default ({ children }) => 
  <SolutionDropdown 
    problem={problem} 
    solution={solution}
  >
    {children}
  </SolutionDropdown>
