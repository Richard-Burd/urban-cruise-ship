## Description

Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are now treated separately for fuel economy standards. We propose that this differential treatment is ended in the US.

## Background

The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards, initiated in 1978, have saved over one and a half trillion gallons of fuel and averted 14 billion tons of GHG emissions. These standards have played a pivotal role in improving fuel economy.[^"1"] When these standards were created, an exception was made for vehicles classified as 'light trucks' which were needed for special instances of hauling where fuel economy was limited. It may have also been viewed as illogical for people to purchase vehicles that were inherently more expensive to drive due to fuel costs. [^"4"] If today's vehicle standards regarding weight, horsepower, and torque remained the same as in 1980, fuel economy would have improved by 50% by 2006 as opposed to 15%. [^"6"] Over the years, the exceptions for these trucks have resulted in increased industry focus. In 1980, 20% of vehicle sales were classified as light trucks, yet by 2004, this percentage was over 51%. [^"6"] In 2022, 78% of new US vehicle sales were SUVs, pickup trucks, and vans. [^"7"] Currently, over half of the vehicles on the road are light trucks, and this is making it more dangerous to drive a smaller vehicle due to the increased possibility of crashing into a larger one. [^"10"]

These larger vehicles are often higher off the ground, and while many people consider them to be safer to ride in, they are more dangerous for pedestrians and other vehicles on the road. It is the height that increases the chances of pedestrian fatality. Pedestrians hit by passenger vehicles are less likely to suffer primary impacts to critical organs in the upper body, whereas higher-riding vehicles are likely to strike the upper body with a flat surface. [^"8"] When compared to a collision with a passenger car, pedestrians were twice as likely to die, and some studies showed up to four times the severity of injury [^"8"] 

Additionally, while there is a common misconception that the driver can see better when sitting higher up, SUVs are more likely to hit pedestrians due to reduced field of vision. [^"9"]

## Benefits

Improved fuel economy will result in less fuel used, lower transportation costs, and reduced greenhouse gases. [^"6"] Smaller vehicles will reduce fatalities and injuries due to vehicle collisions. [^"8"] 

## Costs  

Automobile manufacturers would face significant costs if they were required to shift away from larger light-truck vehicles to meet CAFE standards. 

## Implementation

There are several challenges to address in implementing better standards:

- Larger vehicles tend to have greater profit margins.  [^"11"]
- Larger vehicles are safer for the occupants than smaller vehicles. [^"13"]

Public information campaigns could also assist consumers in making choices, and drive market demand for smaller vehicles. Presently, many domestic auto companies in the US are reducing or exiting the passenger vehicle market in favor of SUVs. [^"10"]
