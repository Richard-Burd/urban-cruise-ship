## Description
Insofar as they seek to address housing affordability for low-income residents, we propose that cities, states, and the federal government do so with vouchers, as opposed to rent control, public housing, and other tools.

## Background
Increases in the amount of vouchers were found to not significantly affect the price of rental housing[^”1”]. Recipients tend to be able to afford slightly larger and more expensive units[^”1”]. This can help reduce the rent burden of low-income households, allow them to live in less crowded homes, and minimize the risk of homelessness[^”2”].

The typical voucher requires renters to pay 30% of their income towards rent while the federal government covers the rest[^”2”].

Vouchers cause less distortion for social welfare and may improve overall welfare when compared to public housing[^”3”].

## Implementation
One issue with current voucher programs that needs to be addressed is the failure to get recipients in to better neighborhoods and school districts[^”2”]. There also needs to be greater incentives for landlords to participate in these programs[^”2”].

In larger metropolitan areas with more vouchers, rent has increased faster than in areas with less vouchers[^”4”]. 39% of recipients of vouchers were not able to find a unit that met the standards[^”4”]. This suggests a slow supply adjustment in low-income rental markets[^”4”], meaning that supply of available units in desirable locations will need to be increased to meet demand.
