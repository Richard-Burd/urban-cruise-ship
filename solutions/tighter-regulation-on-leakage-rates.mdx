## Details

Methane, the main constituent of natural gas, has a lower molecular weight and density than ambient air, which poses a high risk of leakage. Estimating the precise amount of this leakage is a challenge, as discussed above. Leakage rates tend to be characterized by "super-emitters", whereby a small number of ppelines are responsible for a disproportionate share of the leakage. Weller, Hamburg, and von Fischer find, in a survey of pipeline leakage, that 8% of leaks produce 40% of methane emissions [^"3"]. For this reason, a small survey is likely to produce an underestimate of total leakage.

## Calculations

World emissions of methane are 356 million tons per year [^"1"], which, using a 100-year global warming potential for methane [^"2"], is the equivalent of 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide. Of these, 34 million tons are associated with gas wells and infrastructure. According to the International Energy Agency, 28 million tons of methane from coal can feasibly be reduced, at an annual cost of $285 million.

Valuing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at $50/ton, we estimate the value of these reductions at $40 billion. The implicit carbon mitigation cost is $0.36 per ton, well below most estimates of the social cost of carbon.

## Implementation

Many of the methane mitigation projects tracked by the IEA have negative cost, meaning that with the projects should yield economic value, even without any greenhouse gas reduction benefit accounted for. The most expensive projects tracked by the IEA have a mitigation cost of $26 per million BTU, or a carbon mitigation cost of about $54/ton.

Methane reduction could be accomplished through international agreement at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties (CoP).

To date, the Global Methane Pledge is the leading effort international effort to combat methane leakage. It is a voluntary agreement, and it does not include several major methane emiters [^"4"]. The Global Methane Pledge aims to reduce methane emissions, from all sources, by 30% in 2030 relative to 2020 emissions, a target which will require specific pledges and roadmaps to achieve [^"5"].
