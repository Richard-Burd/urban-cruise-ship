## Description

We propose international agreement to control leakage from natural gas well and gas infrastructure.

## Details

World emissions of methane are 356 million tons per year [^"1"], which, using a 100-year global warming potential for methane [^"2"], is the equivalent of 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide. Of these, 34 million tons are associated with gas wells and infrastructure.

## Calculations

According to the International Energy Agency, 28 million tons of methane from coal can feasibly be reduced, at an annual cost of $285 million. Valuing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at $50/ton, we estimate the value of these reductions at $40 billion. The implicit carbon mitigation cost is $0.36 per ton, well below most estimates of the social cost of carbon.

## Implementation

Many of the methane mitigation projects tracked by the IEA have negative cost, meaning that with the projects should yield economic value, even without any greenhouse gas reduction benefit accounted for. The most expensive projects tracked by the IEA have a mitigation cost of $26 per million BTU, or a carbon mitigation cost of about $54/ton.

Methane reduction could be accomplished through international agreement at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties (CoP).
