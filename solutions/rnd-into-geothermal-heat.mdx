## Description

We propose research and development into heating with enhanced geothermal systems, which could provide a cost-effective solution for various low-temperature heating needs.

## Background

The focus on emission reduction in energy production is often on electricity generation, ignoring the need for thermal energy. Heat demand in the northern US is primarily supplied by fossil fuels; however, low temperature geothermal resources that would not be suitable for electric power generation could provide direct heating needs. Traditional heating methods, such as furnaces and boilers, burn fossil fuels at high temperatures but utilize the heat at much lower temperatures, resulting in substantial energy losses. Geothermal heating provides a sustainable, low-carbon alternative by extracting heat from the Earth's subsurface, offering a way to meet heating demands efficiently and sustainably [^"1"].

Cornell university has begun a project to use geothermal to provide for on campus heating needs. The Department of Energy has identified thousands of communities in the U.S. which could be served by such systems [^"1"].

## Implementation

Further research and development is needed to overcome potential problems that can arise with geothermal systems, such as insufficient flow rates, reservoir capacities, seasonal variations, and seismic risks [^"2"].
