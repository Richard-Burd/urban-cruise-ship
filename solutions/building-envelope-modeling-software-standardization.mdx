## Description
Architects need an 'analyze-as-you-design' approach to catch problems early in the design process [^"14"], and government oversight bodies have a need to accurately assess building design performance before they issue building permits.

## Background
Thermal bridges make it difficult to assess the true energy efficiency of a proposed building design [^"1"], [^"8"] and stakeholders have identified this problem in proposed building code amendments [^"4"]. Today’s architects have software designed to analyse building envelopes, but different state agencies and design firms use different software applications, and they don't communicate well. This often causes buildings to not be compliant with state energy efficiency standards, which is discovered late in a design process, incentivizing architects to fudge data in order to obtain a building permit and avoid cost overruns. Additionally, algorithms in different programs can interpret design features differently, meaning that there is no single source of truth, and bad designs can slip through the building permit approval process [^"3"].

## Calculations
We conservatively estimated the cost of development based off the Department of Energy's spending on Spawn-of-EnergyPlus (Spawn) that totaled just over 10 million over 8 years [^"15"].  Although this project is simpler than what we are proposing, we are doubling that cost to total $20 million, or $2 million over a 10 year period.

For CO₂ reduction we looked at the potential for energy savings (in heating and cooling) from energy efficient building envelopes over the next 10 years. Specifically, we limited the scope to the European Union (EU28), Canada, and the United States as estimated by the International Energy Agency's Technology Roadmap for Energy Efficient Building Types [^"19"], [^"20"].  This report shows roughly 9.75 exajoules from 2020 to 2030, we conservatively estimated that we could harness 1% of that number.  We then looked at the greenhouse gas emissions avoided by those reductions [^"21"] and further estimated that we could save 1% of that figure in an effort to be as conservative as possible when arriving at 12 billion metric tons of CO₂(e).

Our benefit calculations were also conservative by orders of magnitude.  We started with the IEA's valuation of 125 billion for energy saved annually by 2050 at 5.8 Exajoules [^"22"] and asked: what would 1% of our 9.75 exajoules earn us if the proportion of exajoules to dollars were the same?  We then halved that number and rounded down to arrive at an even 1 billion U.S. dollars. 

## Implementation
**Step 1:** The U.S. Department of Energy should develop an application programming interface (API) that will take data from their EnergyPlus [^"10"] software application and transfer it to the DOE’s REScheck and COMcheck applications [^"11"].

**Step 2:** The U.S. Department of Energy should mandate that building permit-issuing authorities in all 50 U.S. states allow for the use of REScheck and COMcheck to submit evidence of compliance with energy efficiency regulations. Individual states can still have their own standards, but architects must have the option to evaluate their designs against those standards using REScheck and COMcheck. States can still allow architects to use other programs in lieu of REScheck and COMcheck, but states must give the option to use REScheck and COMcheck when evaluating a design for purposes of issuing a building permit.

**Step 3:** Once the DOE implements step 1 and mandates step 2, companies like Trimble and GraphiSoft (see image above) will be incentivised to make their BIM programs compatible with the DOE’s Energy Plus, which to date has not happened due to technical hurdles [^"9"]. This translates to a network-effect in which the industry can turn to for a single point of truth.
