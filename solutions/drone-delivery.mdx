## Description

We recommend businesses, especially those in the courier and delivery sector, integrate drone delivery systems in last-mile logistics, emphasizing the potential for significant reductions in carbon emissions, increased efficiency, and cost savings.

## Background

Drone delivery systems represent a transformative approach to last-mile logistics, capable of delivering goods directly to consumers' doorsteps. By leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), these systems promise to reduce the reliance on traditional ground transportation, which is often associated with higher carbon footprints and inefficiencies in urban settings. [^"1"]

The global market for delivery drones is growing. In 2020, the global market for delivery drones stood at an estimated $528.6 million and is projected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32.4%. [^"6"]

The average delivery drone has a range of 10 to 20 kilometers. [^"6"]

Drone delivery can also be expected to provide these benefits:

- Reduced Carbon Emissions: Drones can operate on electric power, significantly lowering the carbon footprint compared to combustion engine vehicles [^"1"]
- Traffic Reduction: Can ease traffic in dense urban areas [^"6"]
- Increased Delivery Efficiency: Drones can bypass road traffic and infrastructural constraints, delivering goods faster and with greater predictability [^"1"]
- Cost Reduction: Over time, the operational costs of drone deliveries may be lower than traditional vehicle deliveries due to reduced labor and maintenance expenses [^"1"]
- Enhanced Accessibility: Drones can reach remote or difficult-to-access areas, providing essential services to underserved communities[^"1"]



## Implementation


Aviation regulations will need to be tailored to delivery drones to ensure safe and operational airspace. [^"6"]

Energy consumption can be reduced by 34% by reducing vertical takeoff. [^"1"]

Embedded GHG emissions are up to 93% higher in regions with a more carbon-intensive grid mix, driving the need for a transition to a renewable power grid. [^"1"]

Drones can only deliver items to accessible places such as front doors or back yards, however these locations could be problematic in that they could be left unattended. They also are unable to deliver to mailboxes and apartment buildings. More research is needed to develop secure way to ensure delivery. [^"2"]

Privacy, and safety concerns as well as noise levels are challenges to public acceptance. Drones fitted with cameras and other sensors could be used for data collection or surveillance, and regulations should be in place to prevent violations of individual privacy. [^"6"] Data protection and a precautionary approach is recommended to prevent a chilling effect of the implementation of this technology. [^"7"]
