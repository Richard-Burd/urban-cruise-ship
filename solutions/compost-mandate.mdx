## Description
We propose to build composting facility infrastructure and policy regulation to compost 50% of all food and green waste.

## Background

The world generates 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste annually[^”1”]. Of that waste about 50% is compostable, which includes food, green waste, and some paper/wood products[^”1”]. Only 5.5% of total waste is currently composted[^”1”].

45% of soils face nutrient depletion in certain areas, which is worsened by synthetic fertilizers[^”2”]. Well managed compost can reduce fertilizer use by 30%[^”1”].

Organic waste accounts for 2-4% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions[^”2”].

## Calculations

Humans collectively emit 54.59 billion tons of GHG emissions[^”3”]. This means that 1.6377 billion tons is from MSW[^”2”] and this solution aims to reduce one fourth of that equaling 409.43 million tons of GHG. Composting produces about 11.8% of GHG emissions[^”4”] compared to landfilling, netting 48.26 million tons of GHG reduction.

Composting saves on relative disposal cost over landfilling by an average of $2.50 per ton equaling $1.3 billion USD per year saved.

The global annual fertilizer market was $171.76 billion in 2020[^”5”]. We assume that there will be a 30% reduction[^”1”] of half that amount or $25.76 billion.

The global agricultural annual water withdrawal is 2,703 km3 [^”6”]. We assume a reduction of 35%[^”1”] of half that amount in irrigation needs valued at $0.13/m3[^”7”] equals $175.7 billion.

The average disposal trucking distance to landfills is 20km[^”8”]. Assuming 35.27 tonnes per trip[^”9”] there is an estimated savings of $0.26 per km[^”1”] equaling $74 million.

The averaged predicted total cost of composting facilities is $149.11 per ton of waste composted[^”10”] which equals $74.9 billion to reach our goal. Once the facilities and infrastructure are in place the annual operating cost is assumed to be $45.10 per ton[^”11”] or $22.66 billion.

## Implementation

One prominent issue with MSW derived stock is that it needs to be source separated and be under an enforced quality control policy otherwise it will degrade the quality of the compost[^”2”]. The Food and Agriculture department of the United Nations should create and update a global standards policy on the production, composition and marketing of compost, while leaving the enforcement up to local governments.

Policies that would support and enhance the development of a robust composting sector include landfill taxes, organic waste disposal bans, and the removal of subsidies from chemical fertilizers and addition of composting subsidies.
