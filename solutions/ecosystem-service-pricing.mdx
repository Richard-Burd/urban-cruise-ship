We propose a tax on land use, such as real estate development and agriculture, to internalize the environmental impacts described above. Such a tax would be based on ecosystem services that wild land provides.

While it is very difficult to price ecosystem services comprehensively, there are several instances of limited implementations.

- Costa Rica's Payment for Ecosystem Services program paid the equivalent of $210/hectare for forest conservation, $327/hectare for sustainable forest management, and $537 for reforestation (2001 currency) [^"22"]. Rates of deforestation were dramatically reduced after the payments began [^"22"].
- Norway has paid Indonesia up to $1 billion (2010 currency) for conservation of rainforests for their carbon sequestration ecosystem services [^"21"].
- Mexico has paid landowners to conserve forests for their ecosystem services of watershed protection and aquifer recharge. The funding source for these payments are fees from water users [^"25"].

To develop more comprehensive ecosystem pricing, it is necessary to further develop financial tools, such as the Natural Capital Project's InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs) [^"32"] or the Planetary Health Alliance [^"27"]. The estimates of Costanza et al. [^"6"] are useful for conceptual purposes, but they are too uncertain and too broad in their focus to be of use for specific decision-making [^"14"].

Ecosystem service pricing focuses on the value of conservation for human purposes, and it should not be considered a replacement for valuation of nature and conservation for its own sake [^"30"].
