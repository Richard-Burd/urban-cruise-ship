## Description

We examine ultrafiltration (UF) membrane technology for water treatment systems as part of a strategy to improve water quality, public health, and to reduce bottled water consumption.

## Background

In 2014, waterborne illnesses resulted in total direct healthcare costs of $3.33 billion in the U.S.​[^"2"] 

UF membranes reduce water bourne pathogens under EPA recommendations by a factor of 300, and they enhance the water's appearance, taste, and odor. UF membranes effectively remove harmful pathogens, reducing the disease burden.[^"1"] Implementation of a UF membrane water treatment was studied in Sweden, and we use this study as a basis for extrapolation across the entire US water supply.[^"1"] 

High-quality tap water could improve consumer confidence and reduce reliance on resource-intensive bottled water.[^"9"] Bottled water originated as a luxury mineral water in the 16th century, but has since grown to the most popular beverage in the world.[^"11"] Despite perceptions of being healthier and safer, studies analyzing bottled water sold in the US have found:
- Chemical contamination at levels beyond national drinking standards (20% of waters sampled)[^"11"]
- MIcroplastics and polymer compounds (93% of waters sampled)[^"11"]
- Bacterial contamination (48% of waters sampled)[^"11"]
- Amoebas (4% of waters sampled)[^"11"]

Bottled water production requires requires 2 to 4 liters of water to produce 1 liter of finished product. During droughts, local citizens often face water usage restrictions, while bottled water companies continue to extract resources without such limitations. For instance, in 2015, Nestle extracted 300 million liters of water from Sacramento, California, despite severe drought conditions.[^"11"]

The bottled water industry continues to expand rapidly. The largest consumer, the United States, generates annual revenue of $64 billion from the sales of bottled water, with an average unit price of $2.5 and a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2%. The total volume sold is approximately 61.4 million liters. It is anticipated that the growth rate will increase to 7% in the upcoming years.[^"11"] At 2.54 kg of carbon footprint per bottle, and assuming 100 billion 16.9 ounce bottles, the total carbon footprint is at least 2.5 MMTonsCO₂eq.[^"6"] 85% of these bottles will become waste. [^"11"]

Perceptions of low-quality groundwater increase the likelihood of consumers using bottled water as their primary drinking source. One study showed that 15% of respondents felt their groundwater was not safe, and 13% of the respondents used bottled water exclusively. We estimate that an increased perception of tap water safety could reduce bottled water consumption by 10%.[^"9"]

Aesthetics (taste, color, odor) comprise the majority of the benefit.[^"1"]

We include 6.4 billion dollars in consumer savings due to decreased reliance on bottled water.[^"1"] [^"9"]

Health benefits are calculated in terms of quality of life and avoided infections and illnesses.[^"1"]

## Implementation

The transition to UF membrane technology for water treatment will require investment from the private sector and support from governments.
Potential obstacles to this transition could include lack of public awareness about UF membrane technology, resistance to change from traditional water treatment methods, lobbyist from bottled water industry.
