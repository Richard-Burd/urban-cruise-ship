Carbon capture and sequestration has a relatively low carbon abatement cost. Methanol from electrolysis, though it reduced emissions more, has greater carbon abatement costs due to the high price of electrolysis.

#### Costs, at $50/ton carbon emissions, and carbon abatement costs of alternatives to unsequestered steam methane reforming. A plant size of one million tons of methanol per year is assumed, as given by Turaga [^"24"].
