## Description
We recommend investing in AI safety and risk prevention.

## Background
It is possible that AI machines will outperform humans in many tasks in the next few decades[^”1”]. This could bring many benefits however there could be unforeseen risks.

Many AI experts think that there is a chance that AI will lead to negative outcomes, possibly even human extinction[^”1”].

It is estimated that there are only around 400 people worldwide working on this issue[^”1”].

Around $50 million was spent on reducing catastrophic risks from AI in 2020, while billions were spent advancing AI capabilities[^”1”].

## Implementation
Governments will need to fund organizations to study and monitor AI safety and risk and continue to stay ahead as the technology develops.
