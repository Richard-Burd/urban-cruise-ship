## Description

We propose that cities with high population densities and high real estate costs invest in networks of pedestrian skyways or tunnels.

## Background

Skybridges are common features in urban areas, but relatively few cities have large networks of connected skybridges that can form an alternate form of transportation through a downtown that is separated from roadways. Some examples include the Minneapolis Skyway System [^"1"], Calgary's Plus 15 Network [^"2"], and Hong Kong's Pedestrian Footbridge System [^"3"]. The objective of such a system is to facilitate pedestrian traffic by creating safer and more comfortable walking routes and to relieve congestion by moving some traffic away from the main, ground-level roadway.

## Calculations

The construction costs of pedestrian skybridges have been estimated at $150-250 per square foot [^"4"], while costs for tunnels have been estimated at $120/sqft [^"5"]. Adjusting for inflation, applying an annual maintenance cost of 4% of the construction cost [^"6"], and taking a 3.5% discount rate [^"7"], we estimate the net present cost of a pedestrian skyway at $410-680 per square foot and tunnels at $330/sqft. Additional costs may include climate control, security, and graffiti removal.

Outside of the most expensive cities, few areas support reliably sufficiently high real estate prices to justify investment in networks of pedestrian walkways. In Portland, Oregon, for instance, the average commerical real estate price for 2018-2022 was $323 per square foot [^"8"]. In New York City, where commericial real estate has consistently cost more than $700 per square foot since 2018 [^"9"], the economic case for a skyway network is much stronger.

## Implementation

Skyways have come under criticism for bifurcating pedestrian traffic and harming the vibrancy of the ground-level city [^"10"], as well as for facilitating automobile traffic by removing conflicts with pedestrians [^"11"]. While such concerns may be overblown, we do advocate that cities insure that skyways are well-connected to the ground level, as has been done in Hong Kong [^"12"] and as Minneapolis envisions going forward [^"13"].

A skyway network is most effective when it functions as a cohesive unit, which entails that the city maintain uniform operating hours and an ultimate planned route, even as individual property owners take responsibility for individual segments [^"12"].

Security, graffiti removal, drainage, lighting, and wheelchair accessability are important concerns that must be considered from the outset of a project [^"5"].
