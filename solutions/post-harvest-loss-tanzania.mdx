## Description

We recommend the United Nations World Food Programme be expanded to provide hermetic storage bags to assist in the reduction of post-harvest loss of maize in Tanzania.

## Background

Inadequate storage facilities lead to substantial postharvest grain losses among smallholder farmers in developing countries, resulting in up to 40% of harvests being lost.[^"2"] Contributing factors include insecure storage, damaging traditional practices, and pest exposure.[^"1"] 

In Tanzania, maize is the most stored crop, with farmers facing a 7 month time gap between harvesting periods. Postharvest losses of maize here are significant, with up to 30-40% of the harvest being lost in some rural areas [^"3"]

- Annual production 6.3 million metric tons[^"6"]
- Average of 20% total post-harvest losses were found to occur during storage [^"3"]
- Storage structures were often ineffective and lead to increased vulnerability to insects, such as large grain borers, grain weevil, and lesser grain borers [^"3"]
- 75% of maize is stored [^"3"]

To address this, the Tanzanian governement has instituted a 10-year plan to increase their food storage capacity.[^"5"]

While infrastructure is being put into place, hermetic storage bags offer a cost-effective solution, proven to minimize postharvest losses across various crops and regions. [^"7"] [^"10"]


Hermetic bags are reusable multi-layer plastic structures. These bags preserve commodities for extended periods by preventing moisture, pests, and fungi without requiring pesticides or refrigeration. Their utilization can lead to postharvest losses as low as 1%–2%. For the purposes of this solution, we assume 4 uses. [^"7"] [^"10"]

The average for the amount of grain lost due to inadequate storage is 20% [^"3"] Based on expected prices on maise in 2024 of $240 per ton, this gives an estimate of $48 per ton.  [^"11"] Hermetic storage can cut grain loss due to inadequate storage to 1-2%, saving $43.20 per ton. [^"7"] 

Tanzania stores 75% of its maize due to its long time gap between harvests. We estimate the storage needs to be 75% of its annual production, 4.72 million metric tons.  [^"3"]

We estimate avoided carbon costs by calculating the amount of preserved grain, and the carbon costs associated with maize production. [^"12"]

## Costs

It will cost $25.36 for enough bags to hold one metric ton. [^"8"] Each bag has a product life of 2 years, so the cost can be split for an annual cost of $12.68 per ton. Further research is needed to assess the cost of training programs, as well as distribution. [^"15"]

## Implementation

Supplying smallholder farmers with hermetic storage bags could help decrease post-harvest loss, however, several challenges need to be addressed:

- Distribution Infrastructure: While Tanzania has a growing road network, reaching remote farming communities can still be challenging. Efficient distribution mechanisms need to be established to ensure that every farmer has access to these bags. [^"9"]
- Farmers need to be trained to use these bags effectively to ensure maximum benefit. This includes understanding how to store the grain, how to seal the bags properly, and how to check for any signs of damage or pest infestation. [^"13"]

Studies performed in Tanzania on the success of training and hermetic bag distribution have shown a positive effect on post-harvest loss.  [^"13"] The world food programme has similar operations in 4 countries and is continuing to invest in post-harvest loss prevention. [^"14"]
