## Description

We recommend that utilities establish markets for ancillary services, such as ramping ability and frequency and voltage regulation.

## Background

The increasing use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind has driven the need for ancillary (i.e. support) services for the power grid. Unlike traditional power sources, some renewables are variableâ€”meaning they don't produce a steady amount of electricity all the time. This variability poses challenges for keeping the power grid stable and reliable [^"1"]. The electricity market has evolved and will need to continue to evolve to incorporate renewables [^"2"].

Market structures include forward markets, which operate on a day-ahead timeline where supplies commit their generated power a day before delivery, and real-time markets, which match supply and demand in real-time, using ancillary services or other resources to meet reliability needs [^"2"]. 

Services like regulation, voltage support, and operating reserves offered by solar PV and wind plants are technically competitive compared to conventional plants. This is in part due to the speed at which these plants can begin providing energy from a cold start [^"2"]. However, the role of solar PV and wind in providing load-following and black start services is still limited [^"2"].



## Implementation

Many developing countries, such as India, China, and Russia, have abundant renewable resources, making investigations into integrating renewable energy into both energy and ancillary service markets essential. The significant penetration of renewable energy into the grid suggests the need for modifications in the current design and rules of the ancillary service markets [^"2"]. There is potential for developing an integrated market that encompasses energy, ancillary services, and renewable energy, reflecting the evolving landscape of power generation [^"2"].
