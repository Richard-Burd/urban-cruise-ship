## Description

We recommend that utilities establish markets for ancillary services, such as ramping ability and frequency and voltage regulation.

## Background

The increasing use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind has driven the need for ancillary (i.e. support) services for the power grid. Unlike traditional power sources, renewables are variableâ€”meaning they don't produce a steady amount of electricity all the time. This variability poses challenges for keeping the power grid stable and reliable[^"1"]. The electricity market has evolved and will need to continue to evolve to incorporate renewables[^"2"].

Major types of ancillary services:

- Frequency Regulation: maintaining a balance of supply and demand on a real-time basis[^"2"]. 
- Load Following: matches supply demand and is essentially the same as frequency regulation except that it addresses variations that occur over longer periods[^"2"]. 
- Operating Reserves: the amount of reserve capacity ready to respond to an outage[^"2"].
- Reactive Power, or Voltage Control Support: maintains acceptable voltage within the system[^"2"].
- Black Start Services: provide power generation resources needed to restart the power system after a major blackout[^"2"]. 

Market Structures:

- Forward Market: these operate on a day-ahead timeline where supplies commit their generated power a day before delivery[^"2"]. 
- Real-time Market: matches supply and demand in real-time, using ancillary services or other resources to meet reliability needs[^"2"]. 

Renewable Energy as Ancillary Services:

- Services like Regulation, Voltage Support, and Operating Reserves offered by solar PV and wind plants are technically competitive compared to conventional plants. This is in part due to the speed at which these plants can begin providing energy from a cold start[^"2"].
-Load Following and Black Start Services: While solar PV and wind can efficiently offer services like regulation, voltage support, and operating reserves, their role in providing load-following and black start services is still limited[^"2"].



## Implementation

Available Resources: Many developing countries, such as India, China, Russia, etc., have abundant renewable resources, making investigations into integrating renewable energy into both energy and AS markets essential. The significant penetration of renewable energy into the grid suggests the need for modifications in the current design and rules of the AS markets[^"2"].

Potential for Integration: There's potential for developing an integrated market that encompasses energy, ancillary services, and renewable energy, reflecting the evolving landscape of power generation[^"2"].
