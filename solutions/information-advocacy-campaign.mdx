## Description
A plant-based diet uses fewer resources to produce the same calories and nutrients as from animal sources. We propose to fund an informational campaign to advocate plant-based diets.

## Calculations
Comparing the efficacy of a federally funded antismoking campaign [^"1"] to an antimeat ad campaign, we estimate that as general knowledge of the harm to the environment and health becomes mainstream, there will be a 6.1% reduction in meat consumption [^"2"]. This would lead to 88 million tons of CO₂e reduced per year [^"3"], 131.8 billion MJ of electricity saved [^"4"], [^"5"], and 37 billion cubic meters of water saved [^"4"], [^"6"], [^"7"] per year. The annual cost would be $48 million [^"1"].

A reduction of meat consumption within this range would reduce diet-related healthcare costs by 12.5% [^"8"], or $6.25 billion out of $50 billion in overall diet-related health costs [^"9"].

## Implementation
A petition with lobbying may be necessary to fund the campaign federally. It could also be crowdfunded or independently funded.
