Cities should build district heating and cooling systems as a vital piece of infrastructure, along with roads, waste water treatment, etc., as well as insure zoning rules allow sufficient density to take advantage of district heating and cooling.

The U.S. Census Bureau expects the American population to increase by about 67 million people from 2022 to 2060 [^"6"]. If half of this growth is met with district heating and cooling, the expected energy savings would be about 600 petajoules per year by 2060. If this saved energy is from natural gas electricity, then the [environmental benefit](/energy/energy_production/energy_env) is about $3 billion per year in reduced greenhouse gas emissions and other external costs from natural gas.

As detailed below, Sweden achieved rapid growth in the usage of district heat, and it now provides over 50% of residential and commercial heating [^"8"]. Denmark, Russia, and China are also leaders in district heat deployment [^"2"]. To insure the full environmental benefit of district heat, it is necessary that the systems are powered by clean energy sources, such as solar thermal [^"7"].
