## Description
We support creating an infrastructure of district heating and cooling that harnesses local sources with efficient distribution.


## Background
District heating uses local fuel or heat sources that would otherwise be wasted, to satisfy local customer demands for heating, by using a distribution network of pipes[^”1”]. Heat sources can vary widely and include combined heat and power (CHP) plants, waste to energy (WtE) plants, industrial processes, geothermal wells, solar collectors, and biomass fuels[^”1”]. This ensures that heat recycling and renewable heat sources replaces primary energy as the main supply for heating.

In 2022, district heating met only about 9% of the global heating needs in buildings and industry[^”2”]. This offers great potential for efficient, cost-effective and flexible large-scale integration of low-emission energy sources into the heating energy mix.
90% of current distract heating is powered by fossil fuels[^”2”], these existing networks can be switched over to renewable sources as well.


## Implementation
District heating would benefit from fossil fuel taxes and soft regulations based on transparency[^”1”]. This would allow for greater market share and infrastructure buildout.
