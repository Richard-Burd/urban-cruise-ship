## Description
We propose a Road Use Charge (RUC) on freight trucks to account for the disproportionate amount of road damage caused by these vehicles.

## Background
Spending on highways and roads is roughly split between states (60%) and local governments (40%)[^”1”]. With states typically spending on highways and tollways and local governments spending on local streets and roads[^”1”].

In 2020, state and local governments spent $204 billion on highways and roads[^”1”]. 43% of that ($87.7 billion) went toward operational costs, such as maintenance, repair, snow and ice removal, highway and traffic design and operation, and highway safety[^”1”]. The rest going for capital construction of new highways and roads[^”1”]. State and local motor fuel taxes, $53 billion, and construction and repair fees, $22 billion, only account for a portion of the fees with the rest coming from state, local, and federal funds[^”1”].

Freight trucks cause 99% of wear-and-tear on U.S. roads and only pay for 35% of that damage[^”2”].

## Calculations
Freight trucks average a total of 327.48 billion miles annually[^”4”]. In order to pay for the $129 billion gap explained above (plus the collection and administrative costs) that would mean a fee of .43¢ per mile, which is reasonable and even less than has been charged elsewhere[^”3”].

Collection and administrative costs are estimated to be around 10% of the revenue[^”5”], or $13 billion.


## Implementation
This fee will be assessed as a Road Usage Charge (RUC) as has been done in Oregon and Utah[^”3”].

Implementing a RUC charge for all vehicles as well as trucks could be even more economically beneficial, for example it would reduce the amount spent on toll road administration by $85 million per year per toll road administration and dramatically reduce local governments parking meter management costs[^”6”].
