Total public road maintenance spending in the United States was, as of 2018, $187 billion, or $572 per capita [^"17"]. The disparity in road damage by vehicle weight calls for an evaluation of how this maintenance bill is paid. Although large trucks do at least 99% of road damage, they pay only 35% of maintenance costs, suggesting a subsidy for trucking [^"15"]. Mileage fees are a way to rectify this imbalance. An appropriate per-km fee (in 2020 USD) for Ontario, Canada has been estimated at 0.8 ¢/km on freeways and 92 ¢/km on local roads [^"7"].

The most widely cited data on road damage by vehicle comes from a 1958 test conducted by the American Association of State Highway Officials [^"9"]. However, the trucking industry has disputed these figures [^"3"]. We propose that the Department of Transportation undertake new tests of road damage, but we expect that they will affirm the conclusion that the vast majority of road damage is caused by heavy trucks.

Oregon and Utah both operate road usage charges (RUCs), and several states have conducted pilot programs [^"10"]. Internationally, New Zealand is a pioneer in developing an RUC, with current rates (in U.S. currency) of 7¢/mile for light duty vehicles and 11-39¢/mile for heavy trucks [^"10"].

With a RUC established, the tool can be used to achieve other goals, such as air pollution reduction and congestion pricing [^"10"].
