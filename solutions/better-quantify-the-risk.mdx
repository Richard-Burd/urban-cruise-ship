Space exploration cannot be done with absolutely no possibility of planetary contamination. For example, due to rough waves, protection protocols for Apollo 11 were not following, which could have resulted in backward contamination if there had been microbes on the Moon [^"7"]. Under COSPAR regulations, the probability of forward contamination of any mission should be reduced to less than 1/10,000 [^"2"]. Based on present knowledge, the risk of backward contamination from a Mars Sample Return is low but cannot be shown to be zero [^"10"].

For the most sensitive missions, planetary protection protocols add an estimated 10% to the cost of a mission, with an additional cost in the form of missions that cannot be done at all [^"7"].

The current planetary protection regime is not tenable for crewed missions to Mars, such as several that are planned for the next few decades. Exeriments in Mars Analog missions have observed both forward and backward contamination within days of the transit of astronauts [^"14"].

Work is needed to identify the organisms that could possibly survive an interplanetary trip, particularly those that appear in smaller numbers in Earth environments [^"3"]. Promising efforts to establish a more regular framework for assessing risk include that of the proposed Europa Clipper mission to Europa [^"8"].
