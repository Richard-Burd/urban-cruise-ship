## Description

We propose a fee on mining to internalize the environmental impacts outlined above.

## Background

Mining operations can impose significant externalities on nearby communities, the most serious of which are depreciation of natural capital and damages to the population's health [^"2"].

It is common for states or countries to impose royalties on mining to account for mineral depletion. However, these taxes are distinct from Pigouvian taxes, which are designed to account for the environmental externalities of mining [^"3"]. Mining taxes should account for both depletion and environmental externalities.

Mining taxes can be structured to alleviate fiscal deficits, implement redistributive policies, or reduce the extraction of non-renewable resources; however, this complicates the calculations to determine what part of the taxes can be labeled as environmental [^"2"].

Modeling in Brazil has found that if a Pigouvian tax were applied to copper mining, total mining activity would fall, decreasing associated electricity generation and greenhouse gas emissions [^"2"].

## Calculations

The VATT Institute for Economic Research recommends a Pigouvian Tax of $1000 per ton of effluent produced [^"5"].

## Implementation

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or Superfund, receives much of its funding from an excise tax on the chemical industry, which expired in 1995 and was reinstated in 2022 after the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act [^"6"]. These taxes are assessed on a per-ton basis, thereby creating a financial incentive for a miner to produce the materials in a less polluting manner [^"4"].

A stable tax policy should adapt to the mineral price cycle and avoid the need for constant revisions, considers the whole set of applicable mining taxes, and maintains a competitive mining industry [^"2"].

Mining excise taxes would improve income distribution but also increase poverty, an effect that can be mitigated by recycling some revenue to low-income households [^"2"].
