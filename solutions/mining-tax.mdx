## Description

We propose a fee on mining to internalize the environmental impacts outlined above.

## Background

Mining operations can impose significant externalities on nearby communities[^"2"]. The most critical are associated with depreciation of natural capital and damages to the population's health[^"2"].

It is common for states or countries to impose royalties on mining to account for mineral depletion. However, these taxes are distinct from Pigouvian taxes, which are designed to account for the environmental externalities of mining [^"3"]. Mining taxes should account for both depletion and environmental externalities.

Mining taxes can be structured to alleviate fiscal deficits, implement redistributive policies, or reduce the extraction of non-renewable resources; however, this complicates the calculations to determine what part of the taxes can be labeled as environmental[^"2"].

Modeling in Brazil has found that if a Pigouvian tax were applied to copper mining, total mining activity would fall [^"2"]. This would also decrease electricity generation and greenhouse gas emissions[^"2"].

## Calculations

The VATT Institute for Economic Research recommends a Pigouvian Tax of $1,000 per ton of effluent produced[^"5"].

## Implementation

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or Superfund, receives a minority of its funding from polluters since the expiration in 1995 of a tax on chemicals and petroleum [^"1"]. These taxes were assessed on a per-ton basis, thereby not creating a financial incentive for a miner to produce the materials in a less pollution manner [^"4"].

A stable tax policy should adapt to the mineral price cycle and avoid the need for constant revisions, considers the whole set of applicable mining taxes, and maintains a competitive mining industry[^"2"].

These taxes should improve income distribution but may also increase poverty[^"2"]. Some of the revenue from the tax could be transferred to the poorest households to offset this[^"2"].
