We propose a fee on mining to internalize the environmental impacts outlined above.

It is common for states or countries to impose royaltees on mining to account for mineral depletion. However, these taxes are distinct from Pigouvian taxes, which are designed to account for the environmental externalities of mining [^"3"]. Mining taxes should account for both depletion and environmental externalities.

Modeling in Brazil has found that if a Pigouvian tax were applied to copper mining, total mining activity would fall [^"2"].

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or Superfund, receives a minority of its funding from polluters since the expiration in 1995 of a tax on chemicals and petroleum [^1]. Furthermore, these taxes were assessed on a per-ton basis, thereby not creating a financial incentive for a miner to produce the materials in a less pollution manner [^4].
