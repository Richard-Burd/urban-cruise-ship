NASA should conduct a study specifically into the safety of launching a fission reactor, such as KiloPower. Under current regulation, the launch of any fission reactor, or of an RTG with more than a certain amount of material, triggers an Environmental Impact Study under the National Environmental Policy Act, as well as a requirement for Presidential authorization under PD/NSC-25 [^"14"].

In addition, the United States follows, though is not legally bound by, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (CUPOS), which regulates the launch of nuclear fission reactors. CUPOS requires that such reactors are not put into a critical state until the spacecraft has reached a sufficiently high orbit or is on an interplanetary trajectory [^"14"].

For a larger reactor, the full set of testing required for approval under PD/NSC-25 could take up to 3-5 years, while for a standardized KiloPower design, testing should require 1-2 years [^"14"].

Assuming no criticality occurs, there is significantly less radioactive material in a fission reactors, compared to an RTG, which should improve safety in the event of a launch failure [^"14"]. Such critical would be highly unlikely [^"12"], but more study is needed, as the United States has only launched one fission reactors, the SNAP 10A, in 1965 [^"14"].
