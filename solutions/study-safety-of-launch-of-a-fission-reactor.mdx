## Description
We propose that environmental and risk assessments on the launch of fission reactors be completed to enhance safety measures, protocols, and further testing and implementation.

## Background
Fission reactors can offer consistent, long-duration, high-output power for spacecraft and extraterrestrial bases, making them highly valuable for missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Unlike solar panels, fission systems are unaffected by shadowing, dust accumulation, or distance from the Sun[^"1"]. This makes them ideal for longer-term space operations and exploration, and critical achieving a permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit[^"2"].
[The Outer Space Treaty (1967)]( https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introouterspacetreaty.html) prohibits placing nuclear weapons in space but permits nuclear power systems if used peacefully and responsibly. In addition [The UN Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space (1992)]( https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/47/68) recommends minimizing the risk of release of radioactive material during launch and operation.
Under current regulation, the launch of any fission reactor, or of an RTG with more than a certain amount of material, triggers an Environmental Impact Study under the National Environmental Policy Act, as well as a requirement for Presidential authorization under PD/NSC-25 [^"14"].
In addition, the United States follows, though is not legally bound by, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (CUPOS), which regulates the launch of nuclear fission reactors. CUPOS requires that such reactors are not put into a critical state until the spacecraft has reached a sufficiently high orbit or is on an interplanetary trajectory [^"14"].
For a larger reactor, the full set of testing required for approval under PD/NSC-25 could take up to 3-5 years, while for a standardized KiloPower design, testing should require 1-2 years [^"14"].
Assuming no criticality occurs, there is significantly less radioactive material in a fission reactors, compared to an RTG, which should improve safety in the event of a launch failure [^"14"]. Such critical would be highly unlikely [^"12"], but more study is needed, as the United States has only launched one fission reactor, the SNAP 10A, in 1965 [^"14"].
Current efforts include:  
<b>NASA & DOE KiloPower Program:</b> Demonstrating small-scale fission power prototypes and aims to deploy a 40-kilowatt surface fission reactor on the Moon by 2030[^"1"].  
<b>NASA’s Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) research:</b> Focuses on using fission to power ion thrusters for deep space missions, such as missions to Mars[^"3"].

## Implementation
NASA should finalize designs for space-rated fission reactors like KiloPower, test sub-critical assemblies, and simulate crash conditions. Environmental Impact Studies should be conducted and used to help develop safety protocols and robust containment launch pad designs. Current best practices should be used to guide launch safety protocols and all testing should be analyzed to further develop future safety protocols[^"4"].
