Although it is critical to manage new space junk to avoid adding to the problem, it is also necessary to remove some junk already in orbit. Missions such as ClearSpace-1 are necessary to develop the techniques for doing so.

ClearSpace-1 is budgeted for 86 million Euros, or about $100 million at the exchange rate at the time of program announcement [^"10"]. This and several other missions to advance ADR technology, together with the $600 million per year that an active ADR program might cost [^"2"], is a small fraction of the trillions of dollars of value that ADR, together with tighter regulation on the creation of orbital debris, would create in an orbital economy.
