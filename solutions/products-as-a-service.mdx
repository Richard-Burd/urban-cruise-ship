## Description
We promote the business model of treating products as a service.

## Background
Modern consumerism operates on a linear economy model: extraction of  raw materials, manufacturing of  goods, selling goods to consumers, then disposal at end of life and repeat[^"5"]. Products are often designed with planned obsolescence in mind to drive continual purchasing[^"1"]. This model results in high resource extraction and energy use, [electronic]( https://www.urbancruiseship.org/waste/hazardous_waste/ewaste) and material waste accumulation, low access to repairability or upgradability, and low incentives for improvements when it comes to manufacturer’s product end-of-life responsibilities.

Treating products as services is a model in which consumers pay for the utility of a product without owning it. The manufacturer retains ownership and responsibility for maintenance, upgrades, and end-of-life recycling. This aligns profit motives with durability, efficiency, and sustainability. There are two business models currently that achieve this.

<b>Subscription Model</b> - Users pay a monthly or yearly fee to access a product. This model usually includes installation, maintenance, repair, and replacement. An example of this is leasing a car.

<b>Pay-per-Use Model</b> - Consumers pay only for the usage of the product (e.g., per wash cycle, print, or hour of operation). An example of this is the Philips “Pay-per-Lux” lighting system for commercial buildings where customers pay for light, not the fixtures or electricity[^"2"].

The following is a list of example product areas where a product as a service business model would be applicable:  
<b>Home appliances</b> - washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators, stoves, HVAC units, air purification systems  
<b>Electronics</b> - smartphones, laptops, printers, TVs  
<b>Tools and equipment</b> - drills, saws, lawncare and garden equipment  
<b>Transportation</b> – automobiles, bikes, scooters  
<b>In-home Medical devices</b> - CPAP machines, glucose monitors  

## Implementation
Governments can play a vital role in scaling products as a service models by offering tax credits or subsidies for companies that adopt these models or low-interest loans or grants to new companies using this model. Extended producer responsibility regulations that require manufacturers to manage products at end-of-life would help to move producers towards products as a service model[^"3"]. 

Digital platforms utilizing blockchain or IoT systems for usage tracking, billing, and predictive maintenance could help companies shift their focus towards products as a service models[^"4"].

Using this model for appliance and tool [Lending Libraries]( https://www.urbancruiseship.org/waste/material_reduction) would further enhance waste reduction by sharing products between people.
