## Description

We propose that water rights be priced in accordance with the cost of provision, especially in water-stressed regions such as California.

## Background

Water rights pricing should reflect the marginal cost of water provision to encourage efficient use and allocation of water resources. The argument for setting water prices equal to the marginal cost of provision stems from the need to Setting prices to reflect the true costs of water, thus encourages efficient usage and reduces wasting. Economists advocate for this approach as it aligns with the principle of efficient resource allocation, ensuring that water is used where it is most valued[^"3"] Population growth, climate change, and inequalities to access have increased the need to address this topic[^"2"]. 

"Smart water metering" technologies could be effective tools for promoting water conservation at the consumer level. By allowing for individual usage tracking, these technologies can lead to significant reductions in water consumption, ranging from 20-40%. This not only aids in identifying leaks but also incentivizes users to adopt more water-efficient behaviors, contributing to overall water savings[^"4"].



## Implementation

Water pricing in Chile has shown success in improving water conservation and access via water pricing reforms, and may serve as a case study for implementation in other areas of the world [^"1"].

The adoption of  such pricing mechanisms faces challenges. These adjustments can disproportionately affect small farmers, highlighting the need for a nuanced approach to water pricing policies [^"5"]. They must also be complemented by efforts to address the social and economic dimensions of water use, such as the  impacts on different income groups and ensuring that policies do not exacerbate existing inequalities [^"2"]. 

The success of water pricing and metering initiatives depends significantly on public acceptance and the political will to implement changes that may initially be unpopular [^"2"].
