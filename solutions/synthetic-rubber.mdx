## Description
Industry should expand the use of synthetic rubber, where applicable.

## Background
In 2013, world production of natural rubber reached 12 million metric tons[^”1”].

Synthetic rubbers are more resistant to oil, certain chemicals, and oxygen; have better aging and weathering characteristics; and demonstrate better resilience over a wider temperature range[^”2”].


## Calculations


## Implementation
Synthetic rubber does not yet exist that can match the key properties of natural rubber, including high elasticity, high resilience, dynamic performance, high tensile strength, good wear resistance, low electrical conductivity, and excellent heat dispersion[^”2”]. Production of alternative natural rubbers such as guayule and rubber dandelion may need to be established to meet future demand.
