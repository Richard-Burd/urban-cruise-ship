## Description
We promote the cultivation and production of alternative sources of natural rubber from guayule and rubber dandelion.

## Background
Rubber production is critical for manufacturing tires, industrial products, and medical supplies. Currently, natural rubber is primarily sourced from Hevea Brasiliensis (rubber trees) cultivated in tropical regions. These plantations, concentrated in Southeast Asia, contribute to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, monoculture plantations are vulnerable to pests and diseases, threatening supply stability.
In 2013, world production of natural rubber reached 12 million metric tons[^"1"]. Demand for rubber is expected to rise significantly. The global natural rubber market, valued at approximately $40 billion in 2023[^"3"]:, is projected to grow by 5% annually[^"3"]:, driven by increased demand from automotive, medical, and industrial sectors. Synthetic rubber does not yet exist that can match the key properties of natural rubber, including high elasticity, high resilience, dynamic performance, high tensile strength, good wear resistance, low electrical conductivity, and excellent heat dispersion[^"2"]. 
Alternative sources, such as guayule (a shrub native to arid regions) and rubber dandelion (a fast-growing plant), offer promising solutions to mitigate environmental impacts while diversifying supply.

## Calculations

Establishing guayule and dandelion cultivation requires land preparation, planting, and processing infrastructure. Once established there will be annual maintenance, harvesting, and processing costs. Currently there will also need to be further research and development investment into the optimization of rubber extraction from guayule and rubber dandelion.
Benefits to the environment include reduction in deforestation and carbon emissions when compared to traditional rubber plantations. Guayule and rubber dandelion thrive in arid and temperate climates which will contribute to improved soil health and reduced water usage.
New markets in various countries would mean more self-sufficient supplies for those countries and a reduced reliance on Southeast Asian imports.
The market value of alternative natural rubbers should be a significant benefit while also adding jobs in farming, processing, and logistics.

## Implementation
The most likely funding would come from tire manufacturers and other industrial firms seeking stable and sustainable rubber supplies. Other funding sources may come from government grants for sustainable agriculture or from universities in the form of research grants focused on agricultural innovation.
Natural rubber from alternative sources will need to meet industry standards for performance and quality.
