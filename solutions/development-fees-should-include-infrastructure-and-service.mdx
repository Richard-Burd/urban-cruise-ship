## Description
We propose that new development fees imposed by cities include the marginal cost of providing infrastructure and services.

## Background
We propose a comprehensive approach to the calculation of development fees. This would include differential fees based on density, charging more per unit for a single family buildings and less for multifamily buildings[^”1”], [^”2”]. Charging by area rather than by facility for commercial office, and industrial buildings[^”1”], [^”2”]. In addition to this strategy, cities should estimate the marginal hook-up and annual costs of providing a proposed development electrical, sewer, garbage, police, fire, education, and other infrastructure and services and set fees equal to the marginal cost.
