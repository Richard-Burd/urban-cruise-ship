Cities typically assess fees on new development. Those fees should reflect the marginal cost of providing infrastructure and services. Many cities charge differential fees based on density; for example, Cudahy, California charges more per unit for single family buildings than multifamily buildings, and for commercial, office, and industrial development, charges by area rather than per facility [^"5"]. Sunnyvale, California charges greater per-unit fees for lower density development [^"2"].

We propose a much more comprehensive approach to the calculation of development fees. Cities should estimate the marginal hook-up and annual costs of providing a proposed development electrical, sewer, garbage, police, fire, education, and other infrastructure and services and set fees equal to the marginal cost.
