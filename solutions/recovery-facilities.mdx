## Description
We propose the construction of reuse facilities, including compost, injection molding with recycled materials, aggregates, and pyrolysis.

## Background
Recycling and waste management are pivotal in addressing the global waste crisis. Currently, most recycling systems are focused on basic material recovery (e.g., metals, paper, and certain plastics), but this system has significant limitations. Only about 9% of plastics are recycled globally[^"1"], and large amounts of materials, including valuable ones, end up in landfills or incinerators. These inefficiencies contribute to environmental degradation and economic losses.

Constructing additional reuse facilities, such as those specializing in injection molding with recycled materials, aggregate recycling, and pyrolysis, can significantly enhance waste processing. Injection molding facilities using recycled plastics can repurpose waste into new products. Aggregates facilities can reclaim concrete and other construction waste, reducing the need for virgin materials. Pyrolysis facilities can convert non-recyclable plastics into usable fuels or chemical feedstocks.

According to the World Bank’s report on waste management, annual global waste production is projected to reach 3.4 billion metric tons by 2050[^"2"]. If new reuse facilities collectively manage just 10% of this waste, they could divert approximately 340 million metric tons annually, significantly reducing environmental impacts and resource consumption.


## Calculations

Costs would include construction costs as well as ongoing operation and management for each type of facility: injection molding, aggregate recycling, and pyrolysis. These costs would be multiplied by the number of facilities that need to be built.

Benefits would include reduced landfill tipping fees from the 340 million tons of diverted waste. The value of recovered material and creation of jobs for these new facilities would also be counted as benefits.

## Implementation
With proper collection and landfill taxation, the private sector should produce most of the needed reuse facilities. However, to kickstart markets for recycled goods, it may be appropriate for the federal government to help finance reuse facilities through below-market-rate loans, as the Environmental Protection Agency now does with wastewater treatment facilities [^"26"].

Further funding could come from government grants or subsidies aimed at environmental sustainability. Corporations with sustainability goals could be willing investors. Green bonds issued by municipalities or private entities specifically for financing green projects could be used. Waste reduction should also produce carbon credits that could be used to offset costs.

Permitting and compliance with environmental standards may delay construction and operations. Once built, a further complication is that recycled material markets can be unpredictable, potentially affecting revenue streams[^"3"].
