## Description
We recommend a research program for Luminescent Solar Concentrator (LSC) technology.

## Background
LSC has an important role in the portfolio of research endeavors because it shows a potential efficiency of greater than 30%, more than other solar technologies[^”1”].

## Calculations
We estimate the expected benefit of a building-integrated solar (LSC) research program to be about $44 billion and the cost to be $21 billion. The potential LCOE of LSC has been estimated at 3.72 ¢/kWh[^”2”], a remarkably low value that would outcompete most other electricity sources. We estimate that a BIS research program would take 25 years, as the technology is still not well-developed, and the annual cost would be $830 million, the same as a [wave](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/mhk) research program. See our [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) analysis for more information.
