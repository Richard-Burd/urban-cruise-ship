## Description
We recommend a research program for luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) technology.

## Background
LSC has an important role in the portfolio of research endeavors because it shows a potential efficiency of greater than 30%, more than other solar technologies [^”1”]. LSC also has an increased conversion efficiency for overcast and cloudy sky conditions, reducing variability [^”2”]. For locations with more overcast conditions, overall annual performance of LSC is expected to be greater, measured by the ratio between average and peak production, compared to conventional PV [^”2”].

## Calculations
We estimate the benefit of a building-integrated solar (LSC) research program to be about $44 billion and the cost to be $21 billion. The potential LCOE of LSC has been estimated at 3.72 ¢/kWh [^”2”], a remarkably low value that would outcompete most other electricity sources. We estimate that a LSC research program would take 25 years, as the technology is still not well-developed, and the annual cost would be $830 million, the same as a [wave](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/mhk) research program. See our [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) analysis for more information.

## Implementation
LSC devices are very flexible in design, with a variety of possible shapes and colors, this allows them to be used in the built environment. Example of such uses are sound barriers, bus stop roofs, awnings, windows, paving, and siding tiles [^”4”]. These built environment options could make LSC a common part of the urban setting.

There is a misperception that LSC is just a low-efficiency solar panel. Currently LSC is a highly adaptive photonic platform with more capabilities and potential than just generating electricity from light [^”5”]. Applications include "smart" windows, chemical reactors, horticultural applications, optical communications, and real-time responsive systems [^”5”]. Exploring these alternate capabilities could boost the use of this technology in unforeseen ways.
