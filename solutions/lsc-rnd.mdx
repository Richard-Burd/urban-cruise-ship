## Background

Research interest in LSC began in 1977, spurred by the search for alternative energy sources in the wake of the energy crisis and the hope for an alternative to silicon solar cells, which at that time were too expensive for mainstream commercial use. Interest cooled after 1988 and revived in the new century, after first the development of quantum dots and then of new fluorescent materials and other advancements [^"7"]. Though LSC is not yet deployed commercially, start-up companies are working to do so [^"8"].

LSC shows a theoretical efficiency of greater than 30%, higher than other crystalline silicon panels [^"1"], but as of 2024, the best efficiency observed is 7.6% [^"6"]. LSC also has an increased conversion efficiency for overcast and cloudy sky conditions, reducing variability [^"2"]. For locations with more overcast conditions, overall annual performance of LSC is expected to be greater, measured by the ratio between average and peak production, compared to conventional PV [^"2"].

Due to the lightweight and flexible nature of LSC, and its ability to harness diffuse light, LSC is of particular interest for integration into the urban environment and has also been called building-integrated solar. With building integration, the thermal energy generated at the photovoltaic collectors can be used directly to heat the building, further enhancing the system's effective efficiency [^"9"]. The excess heat on the panel's edge has also been suggested as a form of energy storage [^"3"]. A simplified PV-assisted water electrolysis system, which would reduce capital costs over electrolysis from grid electricity, is also suggested [^"10"].

Further applications include "smart" windows, chemical reactors, horticultural applications, optical communications, and real-time responsive systems [^"5"]. Exploring these alternate capabilities could boost the use of this technology in unforeseen ways. In the built environment, suggested applications include sound barriers, bus stop roofs, awnings, windows, paving, and siding tiles [^"4"].



## Calculations
We estimate the benefit of a building-integrated solar (LSC) research program to be about $44 billion and the cost to be $21 billion. The potential LCOE of LSC has been estimated at 3.72 ¢/kWh [^"2"], a remarkably low value that would outcompete most other electricity sources. We estimate that a LSC research program would take 25 years, as the technology is still not well-developed, and the annual cost would be $830 million, the same as a [wave](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/mhk) research program. See our [research and development](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/rd) analysis for more information.



## Implementation

Today, LSC exists only in the laboratory and requires significant work before it is ready to be deployed commercially. Needed areas of development include high yield luminosphores, which are materials in the waveguiding structure that absorb and re-emit light, and better waveguiding material that guides more light to the PV devices [^"1"].
