## Description
We recommend the World Trade Organization ban all high-seas fishing.

## Background
Globally
- The average human consumes twice as much fish as they did in 1970 [^"3"]
- 57% of the world’s fisheries are fished at their maximum capacity [^"4"]
- 34.2% are fished beyond the limits of sustainability [^"5"]
- 22.7% of seafood comes from unsustainable sources [^"5"]

High-seas fishing is defined as fishing in areas outside of the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone of a country (EEZ).
- Without subsidies, over half of high-sea fishing practices become unprofitable [^"1"]
- Ending the practice of deep-fishing altogether would result in no loss in global catch [^"6"]
- The majority of commercially fished catch move back and forth between high seas and coastal EEZ areas [^"6"]
- Reducing or eliminating high-seas fishing would result in better catches inside of EEZ, making a more equitable distribution of fishing profits [^"6"]

Forced labor is one of the primary cost-reducing factors in high-seas fishing that could account for what would otherwise be unprofitable. [^"1"] A total ban on high-seas fishing has been recommended by scientists[^"6"]. The WTO has recently banned certain fishing subsidies which support overfished stocks [^"7"], however, this deal still allows for the support of unsustainable fishing.  [^"9"]

## Calculations
A complete closure of the high-seas to fishing would simultaneously give rise to large gains in fisheries profit (>100%), fisheries yields (>30%), and fish stock conservation (>150%)[^"10"].

The Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, would decrease from 0.66 to 0.33, thus inequality in the distribution of fisheries benefits among the world's maritime countries could be reduced by 50%[^"11"].

## Implementation
The WTO is set to open negotiations again in 2023 to address harmful fishing subsidies. [^"9"] We recommend that they take further steps to ban high-seas fishing altogether.
Informational campaigns may be helpful to gain public and political support for the ban of high-seas fishing.
