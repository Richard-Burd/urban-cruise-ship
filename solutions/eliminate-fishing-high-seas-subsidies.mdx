## Description

We recommend the World Trade Organization ban all high-seas fishing subsidies.

## Background

Globally
- The average human consumes twice as much fish as they did in 1970 [^"3"]
- 57% of the world’s fisheries are fished at their maximum capacity [^"4"]
- 34.2% are fished beyond the limits of sustainability [^"5"]
- 22.7% of seafood comes from unsustainable sources [^"5"]

High-seas fishing is defined as fishing in areas outside of the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone of a country (EEZ).
- Without subsidies, over half of high-sea fishing practices become unprofitable [^”1”]
- Ending the practice of deep-fishing altogether would result in no loss in global catch [^"6"]
- The majority of commercially fished catch move back and forth between high seas and coastal EEZ areas [^"6"]
- Reducing or eliminating high-seas fishing would result in better catches inside of EEZ, making a more equitable distribution of fishing profits [^"6"]

#### Source. [^"1"]

Forced labor is one of the primary cost-reducing factors in high-seas fishing that could account for what would otherwise be unprofitable. [^”1”] A total ban on high-seas fishing has been recommended by scientists, but putting an end to the subsidies that support an unprofitable industry may be easier to accomplish. [^”6”] The WTO has recently banned certain fishing subsidies which support overfished stocks [^"7"], however, this deal still allows for subsidies that support unsustainable fishing.  [^”9”]


Negotiations at the World Trade Organization to eliminate subsidies progressed in 2022 and are encouraging, but there are more details to agree upon [^"9"].

## Implementation

The WTO is set to open negotiations again in 2023 to address harmful fishing subsidies. [^”9”]
