Many, primarily rural, areas of the United States have drinking water with arsenic levels exceeding the EPA's standards of 10 micrograms per liter (Î¼g/L). Where this is found to be the case through testing, we propose public support for arsenic-reducing solutions, including point-of-use reverse reverse osmosic and dual-tank point-of-entry systems [^"1"]. Such interventions have been shown to greatly reduce the incidence of skin cancer [^"1"].
