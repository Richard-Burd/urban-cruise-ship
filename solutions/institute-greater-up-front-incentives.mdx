**Description:** We recommend that Congress increase up-front incentives for electric vehicles purchases to at least $14,000 per car, up from the present level of $2,500-7,500 per car [^"5"].

**Calculations:** To estimate the costs and benefits of a single electric car, we use the cost figures of Balali and Stegen [^"2"], which are based on average costs for light duty vehicles, and the maintenance and fuel costs reported by Consumer Reports [^"7"].

Reported lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions are as above and include those in manufacturing the vehicle, transporting the vehicle to the consumer, fuel, and disposal. For the EV scenario, emissions assume the vehicle is fueled with average electricity in the U. S. grid. Costs and benefits are not discounted. We assume the vehicles are driven 150,000 kilometers (about 90,000 miles) over their lifetimes. Monetization of some factors, such as vehicle size, weight, and range, is not estimated.

Overall benefits are estimated by multiplying the benefit of a single vehicle by the number of vehicles likely to be sold under enhanced policies. Almost 70% of new cars sold in Norway are now electric vehicles [^"20"]. We estimate 50% annual EV sales in the United States out of about 17 million total cars sold [^"22"].

**Implementation:** Norway offers a variety of subsidies for electric vehicles, ranging an estimated $14,000 to $24,000 (2020 USD) in value [^"15"]. The most important of these subsidies have been measures to reduce up-front costs of EVs, such as exemptions from the value-added tax and purchases taxes [^"14"].

Some tax breaks that Norway has offered, we would not recommend, as they would conflict with efforts to reduce car dependency in general. Such breaks include exemption from tolling (or congestion pricing), access to bus lanes, and free municipal parking. Aside from tolling exemptions, these breaks have minor effects on consumer decisions to purchase EVs [^"14"]. For this reason, we estimate the market potential from policy for EVs in the United States is 50%, less than rate achieved by Norway.
