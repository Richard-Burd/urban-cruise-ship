## Description

We recommend further research into the energy efficiency and environmental impact of the use of maglev elevators in buildings.

## Background


A typical skyscraper elevator can weigh 40 tons, and these elevators make up 2-10% of a building’s power consumption. [^"6"] They take up a large amount of floor space, up to 40%. [^"4"]


Magnetic levitation (maglev) has been used for years as an alternative to combustion engine trains. They work by using magnets to lift and move the elevator car. [^"1"] 


Maglev elevators have several advantages over traditional elevators
- They can increase a building’s usable area by up to 25%, as the shaft infrastructure does not take up as much room, and there is no counterweight.  [^"5"]
- Reduce power consumption and environmental footprint. Because they use magnetic fields for motion, there is less energy loss due to friction and they have a longer lifespan due to decreased wear and tear[^"5"]
- Remove the maximum height limitations of a given shaft. Traditional elevators are limited to 1600 feet for a single shaft due to the limitations of cable strength. [^"3"]
- Are capable of vertical and horizontal movement. This can decrease the need for multiple shafts in buildings that are large enough to require multiple shafts. [^"3"]


However, maglev elevators are estimated at 5 times the cost of a traditional system. [^"3"] Further studies are needed to determine their environmental footprint in relation to traditional elevators, and what future development could do to decrease costs.
