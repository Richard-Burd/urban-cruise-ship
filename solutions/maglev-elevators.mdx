## Background

Due to longer travel per-passenger travel distances, necessitating longer elevator shafts and heavier ropes, the proportion of a building devoted to elevators increases as the height of the building grows [^"7"]. In a typical multifloor building, elevators can require 2-10% of the building's power consumption [^"6"], and 17-25% in highrises [^"8"].

In recent years, elevator innovations have improved the economic performance of tall buildings. Such innovations include destination dispatching, carbon fiber rather than steel ropes, efficient AC motors, gearless elevators, space-saving machine room-less designs, regenerative braking, computerized roller guides, and others [^"9"]. Sky lobbies are intermediate lobbies that act as elevator hubs in skyscrapers [^"10"]. These innovations save energy, save space, and increase speed, thereby motivating the construction of supertall (300 or more meters) skyscrapers, of which there were more in the 2010s and early 2020s than in any comparable period [^"11"].

For trains, magnetic levitation (maglev) works by using magnets to lift and move the car [^"1"]. A similar concept is envisioned with ThyssenKrupp's MULTI elevator, currently undergoing testing in Germany [^"5"]. Compared to conventional highrise elevators, MULTI elevators could save energy and enable unlimited height, but the most compelling advantage may be saving on space.



## Calculations

Our calculations are based on the assumption that deployment of MULTI elevators, or another similar technology, will begin in five years. The market is restricted to supertall and megatall (600 or more meters tall) skyscrapers. We model the market at 13 skyscrapers per year, which was approximately the average number built per year worldwide from 2009 to 2023.

Our reference building is the Brooklyn Tower, a mixed used, primarily residential, tower in Brooklyn, New York. Completed in 2023, the tower has about 556,000 square feet of floor area, a height of 325 meters (1067 feet), and 74 floors [^"12"]. We use a rule of thumb that one elevator is needed for every 50,000 square feet of usable floor space [^"13"].

The cost of a conventional elevator is taken at $1.5 million [^"14"]. We do not have reliable estimates of the expected cost of MULTI elevators, and so we model them to be about 40% more expensive then traditonal elevators, based on the cost premium of maglev trains over conventional high speed rail [^"15"].

We estimate that using MULTI elevators, instead of conventional alternatives, would increase a building's usable floor space by 5% for the same envelope. While this figure may be low--the actual increase may be up to 25% [^"5"]--we bear in mind that conventional elevator technology has improved significantly in recent years and is likely to continue improving. We value the space savings by noting that our reference building, the Brooklyn Tower, had a cost of $750 million [^"16"].

To calculate greenhouse gas savings, we observe that a typical skyscraper energy consumption may be about 58 kilowatt-hours per square meter per year [^"17"]. We model 21% of that to be used by elevators [^"8"]. We estimate that half of this energy could be reduced with MULTI [^"18"]. We estimate greenhouse gas reduction by applying the world average emissions intensity of electricity to the saved energy.

A great uncertainty in our calculations is the eventual cost of MULTI. The elevator could possibly be five times the cost of a traditional system [^"1"], significantly greater than the cost used in these calculations, and a cost which would outweigh the benefits of space saving in our reference building.

Our estimate of greenhouse gas savings is based entirely on energy savings from the elevators. More advanced elevators could make tall buildings economical in a wider range of settings, bringing additional transportation emissions savings. However, this possible effect is not modeled.

## Implementation

As noted above, ThyssenKrupp's MULTI elevator is undergoing testing, which is necessary to prove its safety and effectiveness. International building codes, which specify standards for elevators [^"19"], should be revised to allow for novel elevators designs in a safe manner.
