## Description
We propose that a complete ban on asbestos products and mining be instituted by world governments.[^2]

## Background
Asbestos is fire-resistant, has high tensile strength, is a good thermal insulator, and is relatively cheap [^3]. More work is needed to develop materials with these properties but without the health hazards posed by asbestos.

- 219,000 people die annually due to asbestos exposure.[^"4"] [^"5"]

- Despite many bans, 125 million people face workplace exposure to asbestos.[^"10"]

The industry has argued that chrysotile asbestos, a form of asbestos fiber is different from other forms and that it can be used safely[^"6"], however, asbestos, including chrysotile, is regarded as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization, the United States, and various other organizations, and there is concern that efforts to diminish the harm of chrysotile will mean that deaths from asbestos exposure are likely to continue for decades to come. [^"9"] [^"7"] [^"10"] [^"4"]

Although asbestos is now highly regulated in the United States, it is still used in a number of products, particularly in automotive parts and construction materials [^1]. In fact, the Environmental Protection Agency states that most uses of asbestos are not banned in the United States.[^"11"]

## Calculations
We assume that costs will be similar to implementing and maintaining the Montreal Protocol at $6.05 billion annually[^"13"].

The valuated estimation of deaths is $955 billion annually[^"4"], [^"5"],[^"14"].

It is estimated that workplace losses due to asbestos use and risks amount to 0.48% of GDP[^"14"], or $50.4 billion annually[^"15"].

## Implementation
Asbestos has been banned in many countries worldwide, however, imported goods can still contain asbestos. Efforts to diminish the risk of chrysotile asbestos have led to its use in lower-income countries as a building material.[^"4"]

International cooperation in the form of a treaty such as the Montreal Protocol or the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Compounds could be used to ban its use globally.[^"12"]
