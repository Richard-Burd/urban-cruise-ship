Although asbestos is now highly regulated in the United States, it is still used in a number of products, particularly in automotive parts and construction materials [^1]. We propose that a complete ban on asbestos products and mining be instituted by Congress [^2].

Asbestos is fire-resistant, has high tensile strength, is a good thermal insulator, and is relatively cheap [^3]. More work is needed to develop materials with these properties but without the health hazards posed by asbestos.
