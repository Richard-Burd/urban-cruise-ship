## Description


 We propose that a complete ban on asbestos products globally. [^2].


## Background


Asbestos is fire-resistant, has high tensile strength, is a good thermal insulator, and is relatively cheap [^3]. More work is needed to develop materials with these properties but without the health hazards posed by asbestos.


- 219,000 people die annually due to asbestos exposure.[^"4"] [^"5"]


- Despite many bans, 125 million people face workplace exposure to asbestos.[^"10"]


The industry has argued that chrysotile asbestos, a form of asbestos fiber is different from other forms and that it can be used safely.[^"6"] They cite a research paper[^"8"] which calls on a need for a mesothelioma registry to better assess the link between different types of asbestos and disease. This paper also declares competing interests and some of the researchers are members of the National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association.[^"8"]


Asbestos, in all forms, is regarded as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization, the United States, and various other organizations. [^"9"] [^"7"] [^"10"] [^"4"]


## Implementation


Asbestos has been banned in many countries worldwide, however, imported goods can still contain asbestos. Efforts to diminish the risk of chrysotile asbestos have led to its use in lower-income countries as a building material.[^"4"]


Although asbestos is now highly regulated in the United States, it is still used in a number of products, particularly in automotive parts and construction materials [^1]. In fact, the Environmental Protection Agency states that most uses of asbestos are not banned in the United States.[^"11"]
