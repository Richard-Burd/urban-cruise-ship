## Background

Asbestos production and use date to ancient times, and industrial-scale asbestos production began in the 1870s [^"24"]. World asbestos production peaked in 1977 at 4.8 million tons, and following growing awareness of the harms of asbestos and regulations, has declined to 1.3 million tons by 2022 [^"17"].

"Asbestos" refers to a range of fibrous minerals. Industrial applications are based on the material's physical properties: high tensile strength, resistance to heat and corrosion, high friction, and low electrical conductivity [^"26"]. The term "asbestos" entails crocidolite (blue asbestos) and chrysotile (white asbestos), among others, with the latter comprising at least 90% of world production today [^"3"]. Although those uses are to be phased out under 2024 regulations, chrysotile asbestos remains in use in automotive parts, construction materials [^"1"], and diaphragms for the chlor-alkali industry [^"30"].

Inhalation of asbestos fibers has been associated with mesothelioma, lung cancer, and various other types of cancer. Nonmalignant diseases resulting from asbestos exposure include asbestosis and pneumoconiosis [^"12"]. After inhalation, the body is unable to remove long asbestos fibers, which cause inflammation of tissues [^"27"]. As of 2019, occupational asbestos exposure caused about 240,000 deaths and over 4 million disability-adjusted life years lost [^"2"]. Despite the remaining legal uses, chrysotile asbestos is also a severe carcinogen [^"9"].

Regulation of asbestos in the United States began in 1973 and includes a 1978 ban on asbestos as building insulation. In 1989, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a complete ban on asbestos products, but the ban was overturned two years later by the Fifth Curcuit Courts of Appeals [^"28"]. Despite the 1978 ban on asbestos insulation, the material is prevalent in buidings before that date, is often not possible or practical to remove, and yet continues to pose a health hazard. The collapse of the World Trade Center released asbestos insulation in the buildings, which is believed to have killed 4343 first responders, clean-up crews, and other people in the vicinity of Ground Zero, in contrast to the 2974 direct deaths from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks [^"29"].

## Calculations

In 2019, the loss of 4,189,000 disability-adjusted life years due to asbestos have been found [^"2"]. Mesothelioma, the most severe asbestos-related illness, has a latency time of 20-60 years after asbestos exposure, and so we attribute the illnesses in 2019 to the asbestos consumption in 1979 of about 4.7 million tons [^"17"]. In 2022, the most recent year for which data is available as of this writing, consumption was about 1.3 million tons, to which we attribute the benefit of asbestos elimination.

Asbestos-related illnesses cause lost productivity, but this effect is not modeled [^"14"]. Given the long latency time of mesothelioma as noted above, we do not expect the full benefits of an asbestos ban today to be felt for decades, but future benefits are not discounted. We also do not account for possible differences in health hazards posed by different asbestos uses, differences across world regions, or possible changes in health hazards for reasons other than changing levels of consumption.

Dyczek [^"19"] estimates that the cost of the abestos phaseout in Poland, which was enacted into law in 1997 and fully implemented by 1999, to be about $19 billion, converted to U.S. Dollars and CPI-adjusted to 2024. This figure includes the cost of retooling plants to use non-asbestos alternatives, economic costs from immediate-term layoffs, and costs associated with removals. The cost is applied to 30,000 tons of annual asbestos consumption, which held in Poland in 1991 [^"20"], at a 7% discount rate, to derive a cost of about $45,000 to mitigate a ton of asbestos production. We acknowledge that these figure are highly uncertain, as Poland in the 1990s may not be representative of the cost to substitute asbestos for other uses, and removal costs may not be applicable in all cases. We then apply this cost to the 1.3 million tons of annual asbestos production as of 2022.

## Implementation

In March 2024, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated a rule [^"21"], under the Toxic Substances Control Act [^"22"], that will ban chrysotile asbestos, the remaining legal form of asbestos, in all applications, albeit with varying lengths of time to comply with the rule.

International trade in hazardous wastes, including asbestos, is already controlled under the Basel Convention [^"23"], and so it is conceivable that a similar agreement on the trade of non-waste asbestos products could be achieved. The 1986 Asbestos Convention has, as of 2024, been ratified by 35 countries, and it would ban crocidolite (blue asbestos) but fall short of a complete asbestos ban [^"25"].

An acceleration of international efforts to ban asbestos can be modeled after the Lead Exposure Elimination Project, which has, with great success, lobbied national governments to ban lead paint [^"12"].

Given the long latency period of asbestos and the persistence of asbestos in the environment, such as in insulation, a ban on asbestos is not a full substitute for health care and remediation.
