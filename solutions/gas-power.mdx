## Description

We recommend that governments and the private sector invest in natural gas combined-cycle power plants (NGCC) with carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) technology as part of a net-zero emissions strategy by 2050.

## Background

Today, carbon capture comprises a small fraction of natural gas electricity generation. The International Energy Agnecy projects that by 2040, carbon capture will be applied to 900 terawatt-hours per year of natural gas electricity, or 16% of installed capacity at that time [^"13"].

Gas combustion produces energy through the use of a turbine, similar in construction to that of a jet engine turbine [^"5"]. NGCC plants use two turbines. One of these is powered by the direct combustion of the gas, and the other is powered by steam that is generated by boiling water with the excess heat produced by the first step of the process [^"7"]. In power generation, excess energy is wasted in converting an energy source to a usable form. Simple turbines achieve around 20-35% efficiencies, whereas combined-cycle could achieve 60-80% [^"5"].

Gas-fired power plants with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology can reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 85-95% compared to traditional gas-fired plants. These plants stabilize and support the grid with intermittent renewable energy [^"1"]. However, CCUS does increase the capital cost of a gas plant [^"21"] and decrease efficiency as a result of the need to operate equipment and store and transport the CO<sub>2</sub> [^"2"].

Natural gas emits around half of the greenhouse gas emissions of coal [^"9"], but gas pipelines cost around $5 million per mile to construct, must be connected the plant to run [^"10"], and suffer from leakage, which in the United States accounts for the equivalent of 800 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions annually, which [tighter regulations](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/gas#tighter-regulation-on-leakage-rates) could reduce.

## Calculations

Costs for unabated gas plants and gas plants with CCUS are taken from Lazard [^"21"] and apply to 480 terawatt-hours of gas electricity by 2050 [^"26"]. We take carbon capture to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 90% [^"1"] and that unabated gas power emits 440 grams CO<sub>2</sub> per kilowatt-hour [^"12"].

## Implementation

Governments can provide tax credits, subsidies, or regulatory frameworks to develop and deploy the technology [^"3"], though a [social carbon cost](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) is likely the most effective way to cause a conversion to CCUS technology, and we recommend this path. On natural gas, CCUS is more expensive and requires that costs from emissions are considered.
