## Description


We recommend world governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders invest in natural gas combined-cycle power plants (NGCC) with Carbon Capture Utilization & Storage (CCUS) technology as opposed to unabated natural gas plants as part of a strategy to transition to net-zero emissions by 2050.


## Background


Gas combustion produces energy through the use of a turbine, similar in construction to that of a jet engine turbine.[^"5"] NGCC plants use two turbines. One of these is powered by the direct combustion of the gas, and the other is powered by steam that is generated by boiling water with the excess heat produced by the first step of the process.[^"7"] In power generation, excess energy is wasted in converting an energy source to a usable form. Simple turbines achieve around 20-35% efficiencies, whereas combined-cycle could achieve 60-80%.[^"5"]

Gas-fired power plants with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology can reduce CO2 emissions by 85-95% compared to traditional gas-fired plants. These plants will help stabilize and support the grid as it is increasingly taken over by intermittent renewables.[^"1"]


Building plants with this technology comes with drawbacks compared to traditional plants
- Increased capital costs: these plants are more expensive to build[^"21"]
- Increased fuel requirements: carbon capture reduces the energy efficiency of a plant, requiring more fuel [^"2"]
- Decreased efficiency: the carbon must be captured, stored, and transported[^"2"]

Natural gas emits around half of the greenhouse gas emissions of coal[^"9"], however, gas pipelines cost around $5 million USD per mile to construct, and must be connected the plant to run[^"10"]. This infrastructure often suffers from leakage, and in the United States this accounts for 800 MMTCO²E annually,[^"11"] which (tighter regulations)[https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_production/gas#tighter-regulation-on-leakage-rates] could eliminate.

#### Source [^"26"] [^"21"] [^"12"] [^"1"]



We examine the difference in costs for new power plants built for CCUS opposed to unabated natural gas plants of the same energy generation, and we set a target of 490 terawatt hours of gas energy generation by 2050.[^"26"] We use a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) based on an unsubsidized analysis to determine power generation costs.[^"21"] Carbon capture is set at 90% effectiveness[^"1"] at 0.44 kg per CO²E.[^"12"]

Benefits outweigh costs only when the externalized damage from greenhouse gas emissions are factored in. 


## Implementation




Governments can provide tax credits, subsidies, or regulatory frameworks to continue to develop the technology, and encourage its employment.[^"3"] Policymakers can do more to publicly support CCUS technology with regard to gas-fired power plants, as this has been one of its obstacles in adoption.[^"4"] 


Implementing a [social carbon cost](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) is likely the most effective way to cause a conversion to CCUS technology, and we recommend this path. As noted before, this technology is more expensive to implement, but it is cheaper when the costs to health, and other external fallout from the emissions are factored in.
