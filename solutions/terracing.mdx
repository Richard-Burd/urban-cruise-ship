## Description
We promote the use of terracing where it makes sense to conserve soil. Including distribution of information on terracing construction, practices, and maintenance.

## Background
Nearly 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded[^”1”]. With water erosion being one of the major causes of soil loss and degradation.

Terracing significantly and positively affects water erosion control, with bench terraces being superior with respect to runoff and sediment reductions[^”2”].  Terraces associated with tree crops and forests conserved the greatest amount of soil and water[^”2”].

A significant positive correlation between slope gradient (3°–15° and 16°–35°) and the effect of terracing on water erosion control was observed with the greatest decreases in water erosion occurred at slopes of 26°–35° and 11°–15°[^”2”].


## Calculations
The average benefits of terracing in China with respect to runoff and sediment reduction were 48.9% and 53.0%, respectively[^”2”].


## Implementation
Terracing needs to be combined with additional soil conservation practices, of which the most important one is the maintenance of a permanent soil cover[^”1”].

Terracing is often found to be one of the most expensive and labor intensive forms of soil conservation, especially in areas where there are other options for farming, which can lead to abandonment and land degradation once maintenance is stopped[^”1”].

Most farmers are more concerned with production over conservation and are therefore less likely to adopt these practices on their own[^”1”].
