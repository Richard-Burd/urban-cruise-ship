## Description


We recommend that US food suppliers sell apples, bananas, potatoes, broccoli, and cucumbers loose, without packaging.


## Background


16% of plastic production in the last 70 years was produced for food and drink.[^"13"]


Plastic packaging in grocery stores has grown in recent years.[^"8"] The COVID-19 pandemic drove plastic use higher, and consumption did not fall back to pre-Covid levels.[^"7"] Widespread concern over contact surfaces as a vector for the virus led to increased plastic use.[^"6"] Updated research on COVID-19 indicates that surfaces are a low risk for virus transmission and that surfaces can be safely decontaminated.[^"18"] The Plastics Industry Association wrote a letter promoting single-use plastics during the pandemic, and the USDA released guidance encouraging the use of disposable food service items.[^"9"] [^"10"]  


Plastic packaging advocates argue that plastic increases the shelf-life of foods[^"15"], however, new studies on the five foods we examine here show that the extending effect is not seen in all foods, or the effect is small enough (+1.8 days for bananas, +7 days for broccoli if stored below 40°F) that the environmental benefits of loose produce outweigh the benefits of packaging.[^"11"]

The solution referenced here could serve as a starting point, and we advocate for further research into other foods that could be sold without packaging, and with little to no reduction in shelf life. Based upon the UK report, we estimate a further 100,000 tons of plastic, and 341,000 tons of greenhouse gas could be reduced if other produce items that are sometimes sold loose were always sold loose.[^"2"]

## Benefit Calculations

Being able to buy the right amount of produce has a greater influence on food waste than shelf life.[^"2"] 

The benefit calculations assume a similarity between US and UK markets. Plastic use per capita for the US and the UK is 105kg and 99 kg per year.[^"1"] To estimate food waste, plastic use, and greenhouse gas benefits to the US market, we scale metrics obtained in the UK by population. We estimate monetary benefits in terms of avoiding food waste. We calculated the average US prices of the five foods at $2,575 USD/metric ton. [^"16"] We do not include avoided supplier expenses of reduced packaging materials. 


## Cost Calculations


Implementing these changes should reduce costs. We have found no direct costs of removing packaging or increased logistics costs.


## Implementation

The National Grocers Association could play a key role in changing industry standards. 


Consumers in many areas of the world have begun bringing reusable bags for groceries, and the same holds true for produce. There are a number of options, from simple cloth to bags made from plant starch, to purpose-built produce bags.[^"19"]
