## Description
We propose greater use of integrated pest management systems and strategies.

## Background
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a holistic strategy to manage pests using various methods with minimal application of pesticides [^"1"]. The aim is to keep pest populations below economically injurious levels. This reduces exposure of toxic compounds to farmers, consumers, and the environment. It also reduces the risk of pesticide-resistant pests [^"1"].

Elements of IPM include heritable resistance trait breeding, plant vaccination, polyculture systems and plant diversity in general, biorational synthetic substances, and biological control [^"1"].

The benefits of IPM are a cost reduction of pest control, a more stable flow of food supply, and a reduction of harmful chemicals to humans and the environment.

## Calculations
A total of 30% of global crop production is lost to pests annually, entailing $220 billion of losses from plant diseases and $70 billion from invasive insects [^"2"].

## Implementation
The level of success of adopting IPM large scale will be dependent on governmental policy, regulatory legislation, social relations, economic forces, and cultural background [^"3"].

Growers need to have easy access to IPM information that includes best practices as well as listing the medium and long-term financial and ecological benefits [^"4"].
