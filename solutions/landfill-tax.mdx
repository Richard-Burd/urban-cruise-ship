## Description
We propose a tax on landfills of $100 per ton to account for environmental damages and help increase recycling rates.

## Background
Here is a list of current landfill taxes.

We are recommending a landfill tax of $100 per ton to account for environmental damages as outlined in the section above “Recommended Taxes on Waste”.

## Calculations
The world generates about 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste annually[^”1”]. 36.6% of that, or 736 million tonnes of that waste goes to landfills[^”1”]. We expect an increase of about 40%[^”3”], or 108.54 million tons, to recycling. That would leave 627.46 million tons per year, with a $100 per ton tax making $62.75 billion a year.

Currently there is 199.2 million tons of GHG reduction from recycling compared to landfilling[^”6”], [^”7”]. An increase of 40% would add 79.68 million tons of reduction.

We use the average cost of passing state legislation ($13,625,000) [^”8”] and add the average cost of federal regulations ($11,714,286) [^”9”] to come up with a guess as to how much it would cost to enact this tax. Compliance costs are estimated to average $13,142,857 per regulation annually[^”9”]. Together this equals $38,482,143, multiplied by 195 countries equals $7.5 billion.


## Implementation
More developed nations, such as the U.S., will need to lead the way in implementing a landfill tax. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency can spearhead the movement and, with the help of the UN, expand it worldwide. Local governments will need to implement and enforce it. There may also need to be strict fines imposed to discourage illegal disposal.
