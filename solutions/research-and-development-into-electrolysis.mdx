## Description
We recommend further research and development into electrolysis for steel production.

## Background
Molten oxide electrolysis (MOE) for steel production provides an advancement in the efforts to decarbonize one of the most energy-intensive and emitting sectors. MOE entails heating iron ore to temperatures of around 1600 Â°C using electricity in a liquid solution. This separates the iron ore into iron and oxygen, akin to the Hall-HÃ©roult process of making aluminum from bauxite, but at much higher temperatures [^"1"].
Iron ore is directly put through an electrolysis furnace to produce liquid steel. This contrasts with the multi-step process of DRI that involves pelletizing iron ore, reducing it in a furnace, and then processing the iron in an electric arc furnace to make steel [^"1"].
MOE can use iron ore of any grade, unlike DRI which typically requires higher grade ore [^"1"].
The primary advantage of MOE is its potential to completely decarbonize steel production. By using low-carbon electricity, the MOE process can convert crude iron ore directly into high-purity molten iron without CO2 emissions [^"2"].
MOE technology is modular and can be scaled in smaller increments [^"2"].

## Calculations
Transitioning to MOE will require significant capital investments between an estimated $215 billion to $278 billion. However, steel made under these new systems could ultimately cost less than current prices [^"3"]. By 2050, steel produced by methods like MOE is projected to cost between $418 to $598 per metric tonne, compared to the five-year average price of crude steel at $726 per metric tonne [^"3"]. Annual steel production was 1,885 million tonnes in 2022 [^"5"]. Using the higher cost estimate above, the savings would be $241 billion at that rate of production.
Steel sector emissions have been averaging 3.7 billion tonnes of CO2 since 2019 [^"4"]. Assuming that MOE will enable zero-carbon production, at a [social cost of carbon](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) of $141.4 per ton, the annual benefit is $523 billion.

## Implementation
MOE requires a continuous and stable supply of electricity, which could be a challenge in areas with unreliable power grids. The total energy requirement for MOE is around 4 MWh per tonne of steel, slightly higher than the estimated 3.2 MWh for hydrogen-based DRI production. This technology would need to be coupled with low-carbon energy production. [^"3"]
