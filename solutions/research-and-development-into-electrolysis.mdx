## Description

We recommend further research and development into electrolysis for steel production.

## Background

Molten Oxide Electrolysis (MOE) for steel production provides an advancement in the efforts to decarbonize one of the most energy-intensive and CO2-emitting sectors. MOE involves heating iron ore to extremely high temperatures (around 1600 degrees Celsius) using electricity in a liquid solution. This causes the iron ore to separate into iron and oxygen, akin to the standard process of making aluminum from bauxite, but at much higher temperatures​​. [^"1"]

Iron ore is directly put through an electrolysis furnace to produce liquid steel. This contrasts with the multi-step process of DRI that involves pelletizing iron ore, reducing it in a furnace, and then processing the iron in an electric arc furnace to make steel​​. [^"1"]

MOE can use iron ore of any grade, unlike DRI which typically requires higher grade ore. [^"1"]

The primary advantage of MOE is its potential to completely decarbonize steel production. By using renewable electricity, the MOE process can convert crude iron ore directly into high-purity molten iron without CO2 emissions. [^"2"]

MOE technology is modular and can be scaled in smaller increments. [^"2"]

Transitioning to zero-carbon production methods like MOE will require significant capital investments in the steel industry, estimated between $215 billion to $278 billion. However, steel made under these new systems could ultimately cost less than current prices​​. [^"3"]

Future Cost Projections: By 2050, steel produced by methods like MOE is projected to cost between $418 to $598 per metric tonne, compared to the five-year average price of crude steel at $726 per metric tonne​​. [^"3"]

## Implementation

MOE requires a continuous and stable supply of electricity, which could be a challenge in areas with unreliable power grids. The total energy requirement for MOE is around 4 MWh per tonne of steel, slightly higher than the estimated 3.2 MWh for hydrogen-based DRI production. This technology would need to be coupled with low-carbon energy production. [^"3"]
