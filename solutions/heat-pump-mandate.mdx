## Description
Building codes should require that new homes are constructed with electric heap pump water heaters and also include the option to easily replace these water heaters with tankless water heaters if doing so would reduce energy consumption of the occupant.

## Background
Almost all new homes are built with traditional gas & electric resistance (ER) water heaters installed for providing hot water.  These water heaters cost less that electric heat pump water heaters but consume more energy [^"2"], [^"5"], [^"6"]. Tankless water heaters are more efficient than electric heat pump water heaters for households that consume less water.  Home builders should provide optionality to homeowners so that home owners can easily install the water heater of their choice. Home owners are incentivized to choose the most efficient water heater (for their needs) which is usually the one with the smallest carbon footprint.

## Calculations
One study looked at requiring heat pump water heaters for new construction in the state of North Carolina and found such a policy would incur an up front cost of $29.5 million and return a savings of $108.7 million over the course of a 10 year period and reduce CO₂ emissions in that state by 441,000 metric tons [^"1"]. We estimate the additional costs of installing ductwork & fixtures described below to be negligent in new construction (0.05%) and expect bids to be unaffected.  The extra space for the tankless water heater is likewise negligent given that most water heaters double as a closet with room for storage. 

## Implementation
We recommend state level legislation to to install electrical heat pump water heaters in all new single family home construction. In addition to requiring heat pump water heaters in new home construction, building codes should also require enough room in water heater closets for both a heat pump and a tankless water to be installed simultaneously.  This gives new homeowners optionality when they move in to use either one left behind by the previous owner if the previous owner installed a tankless water heater. The code should also require electricity & gas lines to both locations with shutoff valves already installed in each line as well as both in-and-out airway (HVAC) ducts to service the water heater closet [^"3"], [^"4"].  This greatly reduces the cost of installation and provides the home owner with further optionality in reducing their energy consumption.
