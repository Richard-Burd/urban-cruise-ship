## Description
Building codes should require that new homes are constructed with electric heap pump water heaters and also include the option to easily replace these water heaters with tankless water heaters if doing so would reduce energy consumption.

## Background
Almost all new homes are built using traditional gas & electric resistance (ER) water heaters.  These cost less that electric heat pump water heaters but consume more energy [^"2"], [^"5"], [^"6"]. Tankless water heaters are more efficient than electric heat pump water heaters for households that consume less water.  We believe building codes should require optionality of homeowners so they can easily install the water heater of their choice because they will be incentivized to choose the most efficient solution which is almost always the solution that produces the smallest carbon footprint.

## Calculations
One study looked at requiring heat pump water heaters for new construction in the state of North Carolina and found such a policy would incur an up front cost of $29.5 million and return a savings of $108.7 million over the course of a 10 year period and reduce CO₂ emissions in that state by 441,000 metric tons [^"1"]. We estimate the additional costs of installing ductwork & fixtures described below to be negligent in new construction (0.05%) and expect bids to be unaffected.  The extra space for the tankless water heater is likewise negligent given that most water heaters double as a closet with room for storage. 

## Implementation
In addition to requiring heat pump water heaters in new home construction, building codes should also require enough room in water heater closets for both a heat pump and a tankless water to be installed simultaneously.  This gives new homeowners optionality when they move in to use either one left behind by the previous owner if the previous owner installed a tankless water heater. The code should also require electricity & gas lines to both locations with shutoff valves already installed in each line as well as both in-and-out airway (HVAC) ducts to service the water heater closet [^"3"], [^"4"].  This greatly reduces the cost of installation and provides the home owner with further optionality in reducing their energy consumption.

In the diagram above, we have the following elements:
1. The designated location for either a traditional gas-fed water heater or an electric heat pump water heater.  The former are cheaper to buy and have a higher carbon footprint.  The latter save money over time and have a lower carbon footprint.

2. The designated location for an optional tankless water heater.  These can be more energy efficient for households that consume less water.  New construction should be designed to provide space for these but not install them (by default) in lieu of an electric heat pump water heater

3. The designated location for an air intake that would service either water heater shown above. Some models require an exterior air intake while others do not. By providing every new home with an exterior air intake, the optionality is greatly increased for the homeowner to realize their optimal low-energy solution.

4. The gas line should enter the water heater closet and have the ability to reach both water heater locations.  This ensures that as new technologies develop, the homeowner has the optionality to use either electricity or gas depending on which one is more energy efficient.  The most efficient energy solutions is most often the one with the lowest carbon emission

5. Water must access both water heater locations

6.  Both electric heat pump and tankless water heaters require an 'air-out' ventilation duct. This air should be expelled outdoors to avoid air-pressure issues.

7. The homeowner turns this valve off during hot days

8. The homeowner turns this valve **on** during hot days as explained in [this video](https://youtu.be/saz8ci4WUsc?t=141).

9. Electric heat pump water heaters expel clean, cold air from their heat exchangers.  This allows them to function as air conditioners on a hot summer day
