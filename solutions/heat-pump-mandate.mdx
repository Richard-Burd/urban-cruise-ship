## Description
Tankless water heaters are generally less energy efficient than heat pumps and more energy efficient than resistance heating [^"2"], [^"5"], [^"6"].

## Background
Though not quantified, requiring the pipe hookups for both tanked and tankless water heaters in new construction will not add much to the cost of construction, will allow future homeowners flexibility on their heating system, and will cost far less than retrofitting existing construction for new pipes.

## Estimates
The cost of requiring fixtures for both tanked and tankless water heaters would be less than 0.05% of total construction costs if done as part of the initial construction, whereas a retrofit upgrade (after construction is already complete) would be substantially more expensive, and may dissuade a homeowner from installing such a tankless water heater even if doing so might have a payback over several years.

## Calculations
A heat pump mandate in North Carolina would save 44.1 million tons of CO₂ per year [^"1"].

## Implementation
Building codes should require all new housing units to install electric heat pump (HP) water heaters in lieu of traditional gas & electric resistance (ER) water heaters.  The same building codes should require builders to additionally install all of the appropriate plumbing fixtures & ventilation necessary for the homeowner to install a tankless water heater if they choose to do so at some later point in the lifetime of the home.

In the diagram above, we have the following elements:
1. The designated location for either a traditional gas-fed water heater or an electric heat pump water heater.  The former are cheaper to buy and have a higher carbon footprint.  The latter save money over time and have a lower carbon footprint.

2. The designated location for an optional tankless water heater.  These can be more energy efficient for households that consume less water.  New construction should be designed to provide space for these but not install them (by default) in lieu of an electric heat pump water heater

3. The designated location for an air intake that would service either water heater shown above. Some models require an exterior air intake while others do not. By providing every new home with an exterior air intake, the optionality is greatly increased for the homeowner to realize their optimal low-energy solution.

4. The gas line should enter the water heater closet and have the ability to reach both water heater locations.  This ensures that as new technologies develop, the homeowner has the optionality to use either electricity or gas depending on which one is more energy efficient.  The most efficient energy solutions is most often the one with the lowest carbon emission

5. Water must access both water heater locations

6.  Both electric heat pump and tankless water heaters require an 'air-out' ventilation duct. This air should be expelled outdoors to avoid air-pressure issues.

7. The homeowner turns this valve off during hot days

8. The homeowner turns this valve **on** during hot days as explained in [this video](https://youtu.be/saz8ci4WUsc?t=141).

9. Electric heat pump water heaters expel clean, cold air from their heat exchangers.  This allows them to function as air conditioners on a hot summer day
