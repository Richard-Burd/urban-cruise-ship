## Description

We recommend that national governments phase out all coal-fired power plants and replacement them with lower-pollution alternatives [^"1"].

## Background

Current energy policies will result in a 90% chance of a 3.3°C average temperature rise over the prevailing pre-industrial climate [^"6"].

Coal-fired power plants generate 40% of the electricity worldwide and were the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 [^"4"]. There are almost 7000 coal plants operating today worldwide, with another 1000 planned or under construction [^"7"].

The trajectory of coal remains mixed. Plants have an average lifespan of 45 years, and while Indonesia plans to retire 45 gigawatts of coal-fired power, China seeks to increase coal production by 300 million tons amidst energy security concerns, and the war in Ukraine has prompted some governments to seek alternatives to Russian oil and gas, which has sometimes meant increasing coal usage [^"6"].

## Costs

Policy costs are derived from decreases in macroeconomic economic output resulting from the reduced coal consumption in a given region [^"1"]. Most countries see higher benefits than costs, but exceptions include Latin American countries, sub-Saharan African countries, and Japan due to the relatively low level of air pollutants [^"1"].

## Implementation

Many models indicate that phasing out coal plants before they reach the end of their lifespan will be economically beneficial [^"9"]. Construction on new plants needs to be halted, and governments will need to invest in alternatives to meet energy needs [^"10"].

A plan to phase out coal must consider how to replace the energy currently generated by coal with other sources of energy. Coal power plants provide jobs and economic benefits to communities, and the economic impact on workers and communities that depend on coal for their livelihoods will be substantial. A plan to phase out coal must also consider energy security using [^"10"],[^"9"],[^"1"].

An International Coal Exit Treaty would completely phase-out of coal burning for energy production and could be negotiated under the Framework Convention on Climate Change. This treaty could serve as a complement to ongoing climate policies and provide a clear roadmap for phasing out coal [^"11"].

An alternative is a national coal exit law, such as Germany's. Such laws would set a timeline for phasing out coal and provide support for workers and communities impacted by the transition to cleaner energy sources [^"13"]. Another alternative is a regional coal exit agreement, negotiated between countries that share a common energy grid or supply chain, such as between member states of the European Union [^"12"].

This solution offers a uniquely valuable collection of metrics to see. They are approximately the sum total of several other solutions, which together would replace coal. When combining all of our solutions, to keep from double-counting figures, we do not include the metrics from this solution in our [overall totals stated on our Accomplishments page](/accomplishments#metrics).
