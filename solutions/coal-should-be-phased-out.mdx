## Description

We recommend that world governments phase out all coal-fired power plants, replacing power generation with alternative sources such as wind, solar, and natural gas where needed. [^"1"]

## Background

Current policies result in a 90% chance of a 3.3°C average temperature rise. [^"6"]

Coal-fired power plants generate 40% of the electricity worldwide and were the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 [^"4"]

- Coal: 15.5 gigatons [^"5"]
- Gasoline / Diesel / Oil: 11.2 gigatons [^"5"]
- Natural Gas: 7.4 gigatons [^"5"]

The global number of plants

- 2,082,581 operating [^"7"]
- 190,287 under construction [^"7"]
- 346,800 planned for construction [^"7"]

A coal-fired power plant operates an average lifespan of 45 years. [^"6"]

- China will increase coal production by 300 million tons amidst energy security concerns [^"6"]
- Indonesia will retire 45 GW of coal power plants [^"6"]
- The war in Ukraine has caused many governments to seek alternatives to Russian oil and gas, and for some, this has meant increasing the use of coal for energy [^"6"]

Coal-fired power plants release a variety of harmful pollutants into the air, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These pollutants have been shown to increase mortality due to cancer, diseases of the circulatory system, and diseases of the respiratory system. They can also exacerbate asthma and other lung diseases, and contribute to heart disease, and other health problems. Coal power plants are the largest source of mercury emissions in the world. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can harm the nervous system, particularly in developing fetuses and young children. [^"4"] [^"8"]

Benefits derived from indirect social cost savings

- Air pollution decreases as coal pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter decrease. [^"1"]
- Terrestrial acidification is reduced due to ending of coal combustion that harms plant and animal life and negatively affects soil health. [^"1"]
- Reduced human toxicity: besides the harmful air pollutants, humans are exposed to various other toxins resulting from coal-fired emissions, including contaminated water. [^"1"] [^"14"]
- Land made available: the value gained by ecosystems from the removal of coal, the land can also be transformed into renewable energy infrastructure, agriculture, or other economic activities. [^"1"]
- Marine ecotoxicity: reduced pollutants such as heavy metals, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen compounds released into waterways. Benefits are also derived from decreased eutrophication (the overgrowth of algae and oxygen depletion) incidents. [^"1"]

## Costs

Policy costs are derived from decreases in macroeconomic economic output resulting from the reduced coal consumption in a given region. [^"1"]

The majority of countries see higher benefits over costs, however, Latin American countries, sub-Saharan African countries, and Japan are exceptions due to the relatively low level of air pollutants in these areas. [^"1"]

## Implementation

Phasing out coal plants requires a comprehensive approach that includes policy changes, financial incentives, and public education. Many models indicate phasing out coal plants before they reach the end of their lifespan will be economically beneficial. [^"9"] Construction on new plants needs to be halted, and governments will need to invest in alternatives to meet energy needs. [^"10"]

A plan to phase out coal must consider how to replace the energy currently generated by coal with other sources of energy. Coal power plants provide jobs and economic benefits to communities and the economic impact on workers and communities that depend on coal for their livelihoods. A plan to phase out coal must consider how to maintain energy security using alternative energy sources as coal power is phased out [^"10"] [^"9"] [^"1"]

These methods could be used to achieve a coal exit:

- International Coal Exit Treaty: an international treaty focused on the complete phase-out of coal burning for energy production could be negotiated under the Framework Convention on Climate Change. This treaty could serve as a complement to ongoing climate policies and provide a clear roadmap for phasing out coal. [^"11"]
- National Coal Exit Laws: Countries could pass national laws to phase out coal, as Germany has done. Such laws could set a timeline for phasing out coal and provide support for workers and communities impacted by the transition to cleaner energy sources. [^"13"]
- Regional Coal Exit Agreements: Regions that share a common energy grid or supply chain could negotiate coal exit agreements to phase out coal together. For example, the European Union could negotiate a coal exit agreement among its member states. [^"12"]

This solution offers a uniquely valuable collection of metrics to see. They are approximately the sum total of several other solutions, which together would replace coal. When combining all of our solutions, to keep from double-counting figures, we do not include the metrics from this solution in our [overall totals stated on our Accomplishments page](/accomplishments#metrics).
