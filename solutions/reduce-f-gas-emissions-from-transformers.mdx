## Description

We propose that the U. S. Department of Energy finance research into low-global warming potential insulating gases for transformers.

## Background

F-gas emissions from transformers can be reduced through more stringent control of leakage with the manufacture, maintenance, and decomissioning phases [^"31"]. However, deep reductions in SF₆ emissions will require that insulating gas is replaced by a low-global warming potential option. Several options have been considered [^"3"], [^"9"], [^"10"], [^"14"], [^"22"], [^"30"], but there is no clear consensus as to the best replacement to SF6, nor is it clear when such a replacement will be ready to be implemented.

## Implementation

 When such an alternative has been proven to be effective at a carbon mitigation cost of less than $50/ton, we propose that DoE mandate low-GWP insulating gases.
