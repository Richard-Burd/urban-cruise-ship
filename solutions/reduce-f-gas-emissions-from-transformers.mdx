## Description
We propose that the U.S. join the E.U. in regulating F-gas use in switchgear to a 90% reduction by 2050[^”1”].

## Background
F-gas emissions from transformers can be reduced through more stringent control of leakage with the manufacture, maintenance, and decommissioning phases[^”2”]. However, deep reductions in SF₆ emissions will require that insulating gas is replaced by low-global warming potential options. Currently there are three commercially available options, N₂, O₂, and Clean Air, all of which have a global warming potential (GWP) of 0[^”3”]. By contrast CO₂ has a GWP of 1 and SF₆ has a GWP 25,200[^”3”], 

## Calculations
1.9 M Tons CO₂e of SF₆ is being produced annually in the U.S. from the manufacturing and use of switchgear transformers[^”4”].

## Implementation
Currently, six companies that manufacture F-gas free switchgear have created an alliance to promote this new technology and phase out F-gas transformers[^”5”].
