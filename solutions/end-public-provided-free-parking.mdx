## Description
We propose to charge fair market prices for curb parking.

## Background
Free parking has contributed to auto dependence, rapid urban sprawl, extravagant energy use, and other issues[^”1”]. City planners mandate free parking to alleviate congestion, but it ends up distorting transportation choices, debasing urban design, adds to traffic congestion, depresses demand for businesses, damages the economy, and degrades the environment[^”1”], [^”2”]. Typically street parking is used more for storage rather than short term parking[^”2”]. Free parking engenders a competition for these spots which can slow or change new construction[^”2”].  Ubiquitous free parking helps explain why our cities sprawl on a scale fit more for cars than for people, and why American motor vehicles now consume one-eighth of the world's total oil production[^”1”]. There is no rationale for cities to provide parking for free when parking can be provided by the private market at market rates[^”2”].  

Instead, we propose to charge fair market prices for curb parking, use the resulting revenue to pay for services in the neighborhoods that generate it, and remove zoning requirements for off-street parking[^”1”]. An example of appropriate pricing is SFPark, a parking program in San Francisco that dynamically sets the price of parking to insure that about 15% of spaces remain open at any given time[^”3”]. SFPark was found to reduce traffic congestion resulting from cruising for parking[^”3”].
