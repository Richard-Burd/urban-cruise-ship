Free on-street parking, which many cities provide, contributes to congestion and loss of land in prime urban areas [^"29"]. Furthermore, there is no rationale for cities to provide parking for free when parking can be provided by the private market at market rates [^"4"]. As discussed above, free on-street parking creates an externality which is often addressed by parking minimums, further adding to the cost of free parking.

Cities should end the practice of providing free parking, either by charging an approrpriate rate or by not providing on-street parking at all. An example of appropriate pricing is SFPark, a parking program in San Francisco that dynamically sets the price of parking to insure that about 15% of spaces remain open at any given time. SFPark was found to reduce traffic congestion resulting from cruising [^"28"].
