If the commercial spaceflight industry greatly expands, it could have a severe effect on stratospheric ozone concentrations. An industry-wide agreement to use low-ozone depleting rocket fuels will alleviate this risk. Such an agreement could be modeled after the High Speed Research program, which NASA led in the 1990s to develop commercial supersonic flight that did not result in ozone depletion [^"17"].

Data on the ozone depletion of rocket launches is limited, and the differences vary by more than a factor of 20 by type of booster [^"20"]. Generally, solid rocket fuels emit much more ozone-depleting pollution than liquid fuels [^"15"].
