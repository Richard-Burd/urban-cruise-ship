## Details

To 2050, aircraft are expected to continue to become more efficient, but this efficiency gain will more than be offset by the growth in air travel. Given the importance of aviation to the global economy, reducing demand simply by foregoing air travel is not realistic.

Although electrofuels are not generally cost-competitive with other low-carbon fuel options, with aviation, the need for high fuel density precludes direct electrification, ammonia, or methanol for long-distance flights. For these, electrofuels may be the best low-carbon option. Furthermore, due to the long capital lifespan of aircraft and the logistical difficulty of providing multiple types of fuel, drop-in options are necessary to make a transition to lower carbon fuels [^"1"].

Kerosene, typically used as jet fuel today, contains aromatics that electrofuels do not, without which modern jet engines might not function properly [^"1"]. Although we see no insurmountable barrier to 100% electrofuel, current regulation allows for blends up to 50%, a value modeled hereafter.

## Calculations

In the following calculations, we model a 2050 demand for jet fuel at 29 quadrillion BTUs [^"2"], equivalent to 713 million tons. One ton of kerosene costs roughly $650/ton at recent prices [^"3"], while a ton of electofuel is projected to cost $1720/ton in 2050 in current dollars [^"1"]. Thus replacing 357 million tons of kerosene with electrofuel should cost $381 billion per year.

Excluding transportation costs, combustion of one ton of kerosene emits 3.16 tons of carbon dioxide [^"4"]. We assume that electrofuels are carbon neutral. We also assume that electrofuels can mitigate half of the contrail formation relative to kerosene [^"5"], and that contrails contribute twice as much to warming as does carbon dioxide release [^"6"]. Thus the contrail reduction effect is taken to be equal to the carbon dioxide reduction effect. We estimate the social cost of carbon to be $245 per ton in 2050 in today's money [^"7"], the lower end of the IPCC's estimated range. Thus the total global warming reduction benefit can be valued at $552 billion per year.

## Implementation

Other pathways toward sustainable aviation fuels are envisioned, such as from waste stag from steel mills [^"10"] and agricultural waste [^"11"], though such feedstocks are limited. Nevertheless, the use of alternative feedstocks might present a ladder to developing the technologies that will enable full use of electrofuels.

A blending agreement could be implemented through international agreement by the International Civil Aviation Organization, an agency of the United Nations that regulates air travel. Significant cost reductions for electrofuel are necessary for the blending proposal described here to be feasible [^"1"]. This could be done through military procurement, which tend to be less cost-sensitive than civil aviation and for which logistical challenges can make conventional jet fuel usage less attractive [^"8"],[^"9"].
