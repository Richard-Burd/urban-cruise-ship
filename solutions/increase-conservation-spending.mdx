## Background
Inadequate funding levels are a major impediment to effective global biodiversity conservation[^"1"].

Conservation spending, in inflation-adjusted terms, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture has remained flat in recent years[^"15"].

As the benefits of conservation greatly outweigh the cost, there is a case to increase public and philanthropic conservation spending.

## Calculations
Current spending on conservation falls short of what is needed to protect all biodiversity.

The lack of funding is costing at least $740 billion annually in lost ecosystem services that could be vital to our economies and our well-being[^"19"].


## Implementation
Currently 78% of conservation finance is generated in developed countries, but as much as 59% is also delivered in those same countries, while only 41% is delivered in developing countries where the majority of the world’s biodiversity exists and the impacts of biodiversity loss are most strongly felt[^"19"]. Meaning that we also need to adjust how the funding is allocated.

The 40 most severely underfunded countries contain 32% of all threatened mammalian diversity and include neighbors in some of the world’s most biodiversity-rich areas[^"1"]. Increases in international assistance would achieve a large improvement in the relative adequacy of global conservation finance[^"1"].
