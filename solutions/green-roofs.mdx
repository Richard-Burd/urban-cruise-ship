## Description

We recommend local cities in the United States implement legislation, such as green roof mandates, tax incentives, or direct funding that will encourage the use of green roofs in urban areas to improve air quality, stormwater management, energy efficiency, and aesthetic appeal.

## Background

A green roof, also known as a living roof, eco-roof, or vegetated roof, is a roof of a building that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane. It may also include additional layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems[^"13"].

They can be categorized into two types: extensive and intensive. Extensive green roofs are thinner, lighter, and less expensive. They require less maintenance and are usually covered with a shallow layer of vegetation. Intensive green roofs, on the other hand, are thicker and can support a wider variety of plants but require more maintenance. Rooftop gardens are an example[^"13"].

They reduce the heat island effect in urban areas by absorbing heat and acting as insulators for buildings[^"1"] [^"14"]. They provide habitats for wildlife[^"14"]. Furthermore, green roofs prolong the lifespan of a roof by protecting it from weather-related wear and tear[^"14"].

Additional benefits include:

- Air Quality Improvement
  Green roofs reduce concentrations of several pollutants such as particulate matter, ground-level ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and lead (Pb) that affect air quality, climate, and health. By lowering temperatures and reducing energy use, green roofs can decrease the amount of air pollution associated with heating and electric power generation[^"1"].

- Stormwater Management
  Green roofs can significantly reduce the amount of rainwater that would otherwise run off an impervious roof surface. They capture water when it rains, slowly releasing it through evaporation and plant use. This reduces peak flows associated with storm events, reduces the total volume of stormwater discharge, and reduces the export of some pollutants often associated with traditional roofs[^"3"] [^"4"].

- Energy Efficiency
  Green roofs improve energy efficiency by regulating buildings' internal temperature and reducing building heating and cooling costs. The soil provides insulation and the vegetation shades the roof from solar heat, thereby lowering the temperature of the roof and the air directly above it. This in turn reduces the electricity demand for air conditioning in summer months[^"5"] [^"6"].

## Calculations

For the purposes of this solution, we will assume that rooftops represent 16%[^"18"] of the surface area of a given city and that 1 percent of this area would be commercial buildings and suitable for green roofs.

This gives us around 441 million square meters of potential green roofs in the United States.

We will take the net present values, divided over a 40-year time frame to estimate the annual benefits and costs.

The costs for green roofs vary widely depending upon the type, as well as the maturity of the market. In a mature market like Germany, the costs can range from $15 to $45 per square meter for extensive type green roofs. For our calculations, we will use the median of these ranges, assuming that different locations may opt for intensive rooftop gardens, which come with higher costs, but also higher benefits.

## Implementation

Modular green roofs consist of pre-planted modules, usually in the form of trays or containers, which can be directly placed on a roof's surface. These modules contain all the necessary layers of a green roof system, including a waterproofing layer, drainage layer, growing medium, and vegetation. They can be installed onto existing roofs offering convenience and speed for installation[^"15"].

There is public support for the use of green roofs, and rooftop gardens with over 80% of respondents in one study supporting green roofs[^"19"].

A wide range of existing policy initiatives are available for review for implementation in the states. In Munich, all building roofs whose surface area exceeds 100 square meters are required to be green roofs. Germany is noted as one of the most mature markets for green roofs, whose cost has been driven quite low due to 20 years of development and implementation. As such, it may be a good model to look to for implementation in the United States[^"11"]. Additional policies including direct incentives in Toronto, tax abatements in New York, green roof mandates for all new buildings in Tokyo, and funding assistance in Singapore can be used to direct lawmakers[^"11"].
