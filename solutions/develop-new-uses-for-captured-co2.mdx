## Description

We reccomend researching and developing new uses for captured carbon dioxide.

## Background

For CCS to grow, and not to rely heavily on enhanced oil recovery, it is necessary to develop new uses for captured carbon dioxide including:

- Urea Derivatives: Urea is a compound with applications as fertilizer, industrial products, wastewater treatment, and chemical synthesis. Captured CO2 can be used in the creation of Urea Derivatives. This process avoids the use of toxic or expensive substrates and can be conducted in the absence of a catalyst and solvent[^"1"]. 

- Direct conversion to methanol[^"2"].

- Renewable Natural Gas: by combining captured CO2 with green hydrogen, renewable natural gas can be produced[^"4"]. 

- Integration into concrete production: Research has been conducted into the use of captured CO2 as a feedstock in the production of concrete. This process could potentially reduce the environmental impact of the concrete industry[^"5"].

- Conversion to high-value chemicals: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been used in the chemical conversion of CO2 into high-value chemicals. These catalysts have been employed in various processes, including the coupling reactions of epoxides, aziridines, or alkyne molecules, as well as CO2 hydrogenation and other CO2 conversion reactions[^"6"].
