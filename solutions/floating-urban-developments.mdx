The demand for real estate in expensive, land-constrained coastal cities motivates land reclamation. China has reclaimed about 12,000 square kilometers of coastal land from the start of the Communist era to 2016, with additional large reclamations that have occurred or are planned in The Netherlands, South Korea, Bahrain, Japan, Singapore, Bangladesh, and other countries [^{ WorldAtlas2022 }].

Coastal land reclamation carries significant negative environmental impacts, including biodiversity loss in sensitive habitats [^{ Borzee2017 }] [^{ greenpeaceasia2017 }], land subsidence [^{ ertenRossi2019 }], and pollution [^{ duanzhang2016 }]. Wariness of environmental impacts have led to restrictions on reclamation, such as export bans on sand from Singapore's major international suppliers [^{ wangGoldfield2019 }].

Floating platforms, such as in VLFS (very large floating platforms), have the potential to supply demand coastal land at lower environmental impact [^{ eikliew2014 }]. VLFS has been proven with the Tokyo Megafloat, a floating runway in Tokyo Bay [^{ schillingdr2013 }].
