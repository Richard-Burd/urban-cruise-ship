## Description

We propose that, where financially viable, floating platforms be used to conduct urban expansion rather than land reclamation.

## Background

The demand for real estate in expensive, land-constrained coastal cities motivates land reclamation. China has reclaimed about 12,000 square kilometers of coastal land from the start of the Communist era to 2016, with additional large reclamations that have occurred or are planned in The Netherlands, South Korea, Bahrain, Japan, Singapore, Bangladesh, and other countries [^"1"].

Coastal land reclamation carries significant negative environmental impacts, including biodiversity loss in sensitive habitats [^"2"], [^"3"], land subsidence [^"4"], and pollution [^"5"]. Wariness of environmental impacts have led to restrictions on reclamation, such as export bans on sand from Singapore's major international suppliers [^"6"].

Floating platforms, such as so-called Very Large Floating Platforms, have the potential to supply demand coastal land at lower environmental impact [^"7"]. Such platforms has been proven with the Tokyo Megafloat, a floating runway in Tokyo Bay [^"8"].

## Calculations

While the environmental impacts of land reclamation are well-known, quantifying those impacts is difficult and fraught with uncertainty. Based on a 2020 wetlands inventory around Jiaozhou Bay, China, Yan et al. estimate the ecosystem service valuation of the wetlands to be about $2.10 per square foot at a 7% discount rate [^"9"]. Around the city of Xiamen, China, Wang et al. consider four land reclamation proposals and estimate the ecosystem service valuation of the affected lands to be $18-28 per square foot (2024 dollars) [^"10"]. Considering willingness to pay for environmental remediation, Wang and Zhao find a value of $0.01 per square foot of disturbed wetlands for reclamation around Zhoushan, China [^"11"].

The best valuation of harms from land reclamation to use is hard to determine, highly context-dependent, and most likely involves great subjectivity. It is most likely, though, that any reasonable valuation will result in only minor effects on reclamation decisions. Furthermore, the harms associated with land reclamation need to be considered alongside the benefits of urban expansion, as well as possible harms that would result from a counterfactual of growth being accommodated by urban sprawl.

## Implementation

China, which in recent history had been a leader in land reclamation, has greatly restricted the practice [^"12"]. We are not aware of any jurisdiction that has incorporated ecosystem service pricing into land use decisions related to reclamation. While this may be impractical to do, we propose that particular restrictions be placed on reclamation of sensitive biomes such as wetlands and mangroves.
