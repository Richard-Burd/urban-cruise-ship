## Description

We propose elimination of fishing subsidies, both on the high seas and in exclusive economic zones.

## Background
Subsidies that artificially increase profits by reducing the cost of fishing and/or increasing the revenue received by fishers result in overcapacity and lead to overfishing [^"31"].

A large portion of fishing on the high seas (outside of any country's exclusive economic zone) is uneconomical, but the amount of such fishing is inflated by subsidies [^"29"].

Over 80% of subsidies goes to large-scale industrial fishing, while 19% goes to small-scale, artisanal, and subsistence fishing [^"30"].

## Calculations
Overall, countries gave over $35 billion in fishing subsidies in 2018, including subsidies for fuel consumption and others that encourage overfishing.

The World Trade Organization's budget for 2022 was $229 million[^"1"].


## Implementation

Negotiations at the World Trade Organization to eliminate subsidies progressed in 2022 and are encouraging, but there are more details to agree upon [^"9"].

Informational campaigns may be helpful to gain public and political support for the removal of fishing subsidies.
