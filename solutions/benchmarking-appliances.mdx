## Description

We examine the newly updated efficiency standards for appliances to enhance energy efficiency in the US.

## Background

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently announced a significant update to the efficiency standards for appliances to enhance energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and provide economic benefits to consumers[^"1"].

Efficiency Standards for Residential Refrigerators and Freezers:
- These standards have been updated for the first time in over a decade[^"1"].
- Over 30 years, the standards are expected to save 5.6 quadrillion British thermal units (BTUs) of energy, amounting to an 11% reduction relative to current market products[^"1"].
- Save consumers $36.4 billion over 30 years of shipments[^"1"].
- Emission reductions of nearly 101 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to the emissions of approximately 12.7 million homes[^"1"]​​.

Efficiency Standards for Commercial Fans and Blowers:
- represents the first federal standard for commercial fans and blowers, building on existing standards in California[^"1"].
- Estimated to reduce energy costs for American businesses by $3.3 billion annually, with total savings nearing $56 billion over 30 years[^"1"].
- Expected reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 318 million metric tons[^"1"].
