## Description

We examine the newly updated efficiency standards for appliances to enhance energy efficiency in the United States.

## Background

The U.S. Department of Energy recently announced a significant update to the efficiency standards for appliances to enhance energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and provide economic benefits to consumers [^"1"].

The Efficiency Standards for Residential Refrigerators and Freezers, updated for the first time in over a decade, is projected to save nearly 6 exajoules of energy, $36.4 billion of cost, and 101 million tons of carbon dioxide over 30 years [^"1"]. The Efficiency Standards for Commercial Fans and Blowers, the first such federal standard, builds from existing standards in California and would save $56 billion in energy costs and 318 million tons of carbon dioxice emissions over 30 years [^"1"].
