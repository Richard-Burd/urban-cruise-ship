## Description
We promote the production of desalinated water in areas that are economically feasable. We examine an increase desalination capacity by 36.5 million m³/d annually.

## Background
The total global desalination capacity is around 66.4 million m³/d[^”1”]. This is expected to grow at a rate of about 55% per year[^”1”].

39% of the worlds total human population lives less than 100km from the sea[^”1”]. Making desalination a viable option for a large portion of our potable water needs.

## Calculations
The average cost of desalinated seawater is $0.75 per cubic meter produced[^”1”]. This would be a $10 billion annual cost.

The cost of providing tap water is estimated to be $2 per 3.8 cubic meters produced[^”3”] which comes to an annual cost of $3.5 billion.

## Implementation
Local incentives and subsidies can help to reduce the cost to produce desalinated water[^”1”]. The development of adsorption desalination, an emerging low-energy desalination technology may also help to reduce costs[^”1”].

When desalination plants are powered by renewable energy such solar or wind power this can reduce the long term costs and increase energy efficiency[^”2”].
