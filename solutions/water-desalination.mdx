## Description


## Background
The total global desalination capacity is around 66.4 million m3/d[^”1”]. This is expected to grow at a rate of about 55% per year[^”1”].

39% of the worlds total human population lives less than 100km from the sea[^”1”]. Making desalination a viable option for a large portion of our potable water needs.


## Calculations
The cost of desalinated seawater ranges from $0.50-1.00 per cubic meter produced[^”1”].


## Implementation
Local incentives and subsidies can help to reduce the cost to produce desalinated water[^”1”]. The development of adsorption desalination, an emerging low-energy desalination technology may also help to reduce costs[^”1”].

When desalination plants are powered by renewable energy such solar or wind power this can reduce the long term costs and increase energy efficiency[^”2”].
