## Description

We recommend a more rigorous accounting of emissions reductions from carbon offsets.

## Background

It can be unclear whether a carbon offset, such as an afforestation project or a conservation project, actually reduces emissions as claimed. The primary areas of concern are:
- Additionality: an offset project should result in lower emissions compared to a scenario where the project did not occur[^"2"]
- Double-counting: offset projects should not be counted more than once, such as when a buyer and seller of an offset claim the same reduction[^"2"]
- Leakage: emission reductions in one area should not result in increased reductions in another area such as forest conservation in one area leading to deforestation nearby[^"2"]
- Permanence: the storage of greenhouse gases should not be easily reversed[^"2"]

In the case of forests, not all land areas have the same sequestration potential. In California, regional averages have been used to estimate sequestration capacities. Landowners are then able to select land areas that have lower-than-average sequestration. Over-crediting due to this method has been estimated at 29%.[^"2"]

Auditing and verification programs could be used to verify the integrity of a project,[^"3"] and for afforestation, biomass could be directly examined by improved technology such as machine learning coupled with LIDAR and satellite imagery.[^"2"] Bonding and insurance could address permanence issues with offsets, such as in the case of a wildfire burning down a forestry project that provided offset credits.[^"2"] Insurance could also play a key role in handling leakage, should a leakage scenario be identified after the project has been implemented.[^"2"] 

Some projects, such as the direct air capture programs offered by Climeworks, may be more expensive than other carbon offsets, but we can be more confident that they reduce emissions as claimed.

## Implementation

Future policy changes can reduce offset revenues depending on their implementation. Voluntary offset efforts can inform future governmental policy.[^"2"] 


Having transparent reliable offsets will become more vital as the market grows. Many countries are moving toward a [carbon-border adjustment](https://urban-cruise-ship.vercel.app/energy/energy_socioeconomics/economics_se) and if the offset is recognized, then it may reduce a companyâ€™s amount they have to pay.[^"2"]
