## Description

We recommend more rigorous accounting of emissions reductions from carbon offsets.

## Background

Credible pathways to limit global warming to 1.5 °C, as aspirationally envisioned by the 2015 Paris Agreement, require the large-scale usage of carbon dioxade removal [^"5"]. However, as discussed above, factors including additionality, double-counting, leakage, and permanence often lead to overestimation of the effectiveness of carbon offsets. Due to growing concern about these problems, investors have lost some faith in carbon offsets, and the market's value has lost 60% of its value from 2021 to 2023 [^"4"].

Carbon offsets pose several accounting challenges as well [^"1"]. Among them are accounting for the risk of reversal and whether and how to discount future carbon removal relative to today's emissions reductions.

## Implementation

Auditing and verification programs could be used to verify the integrity of a project [^"3"], and for afforestation, biomass could be directly examined by improved technology such as machine learning coupled with LIDAR and satellite imagery [^"2"]. Bonding and insurance could address permanence issues with offsets, such as in the case of a wildfire burning down a forestry project that provided offset credits [^"2"]. Insurance could also play a key role in handling leakage, should leakage be identified after the project has been implemented [^"2"].

Some projects, such as the direct air capture programs offered by Climeworks, may be more expensive than other carbon offsets, but we can be more confident that they reduce emissions as claimed [^"6"].

Having transparent reliable offsets will become more vital as the market grows. Many countries are moving toward a [carbon-border adjustment](https://urban-cruise-ship.vercel.app/energy/energy_socioeconomics/economics_se) and if the offset is recognized, then it may reduce a company’s amount they have to pay [^"2"].
