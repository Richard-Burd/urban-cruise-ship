## Description
We propose planting trees and shrubs along he edge of agricultural fields and windbreaks to reduce soil erosion.

## Background
A significant effect of windbreak on airflow reduction was proven on the leeward side of windbreak in a belt corresponding to approximately six times the height of the windbreaks[^”1”].

Net present values remained positive over a range of base yields, grain prices, and windbreak establishment costs, indicating that windbreaks are an economically attractive investment over a wide range of conditions[^”2”].

Satisfaction rate 72-99% among U.S. producers that use windbreaks[^”3”], valuing them for indirect economic benefits.

Benefits from windbreaks include: erosion reduction, increase crop yields, provides wildlife habitat, enhances aesthetics, and manages snowdrift[^”3”].

## Calculations
Field windbreaks provide average yield increases of 15%[^”2”]:


## Implementation
Windbreaks, when used along with improved agricultural management (such as crop rotation and cover cropping) is effective to rebuild and maintain soil organic carbon[^”4”].

Perceived cost of windbreak upkeep is the main driver of non-adoption[^”3”]. Further studies on windbreak costs and management are needed as well as distribution of that knowledge to promote adoption rates.
