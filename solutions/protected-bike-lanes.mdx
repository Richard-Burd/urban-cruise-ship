## Description
We recommend local government officials, city council members, and planning departments build or increase bike lane infrastructure. We recommend additional studies be conducted on the state of bike-friendly infrastructure in major cities so that their impact can be better assessed.

## Background

Globally, 63,693 cyclists died in 2019 due to road accidents. [^"15"]
- Shared lanes consist of markings on the street surface indicating that bicycles share the road space. [^"2"]
- Bike lanes are marked with solid or dotted lines on a street. [^"1"]
- Protected bike lanes (cycle tracks) consist of physical barriers, such as planters, between lanes for cars and for bicycles. [^"1"]

Benefits of bike lanes include
- Reduced cyclist injury  [^"2"]
- Increased cycling. 77% reported they would begin cycling if there were a separated bike lane [^"3"]
- Improving equity amongst race, ethnicity, and class [^"5"]
- Health benefits to riders [^"6"]
- Health benefits to non-riders due to reduced air pollution [^"7"]
- Increased spending and employment in local businesses [^"8"]
- Decreased pedestrian injury due to bicycle collisions [^"9"]

Protected bike lanes can range between $133,170 to $536,680 per mile. [^"11"]

## Implementation
Speed limits can serve as a model for assessing different streets for their infrastructure needs. Roads with higher traffic speeds need higher levels of protection. A model based on the infrastructure of Copenhagen is as follows:

- Less than 15 mph: No separation needed
- Up to 25 mph: Painted lanes separating bike traffic
- Beyond 25 mph: Protected lanes [^"14"]

Methods to create a physical separation include recycled tires for dividers. [^"12"] 

Some studies indicate a higher number of crashes in protected bike lanes, but fewer fatalities and serious crashes. Most of these incidents occur at intersections, either with turning vehicles or with pedestrians entering the lanes. These can be mitigated by placing protected bike lanes where there are fewer intersections, implementing raised cycle crossings, and taking measures to prevent pedestrians from entering lanes.
