## Description
We propose streamlining the approval process to construct new housing as well as expediting higher density housing construction and remodeling.


## Background
In most cities in the U.S., the process associated with obtaining approval for new construction is so time-consuming that it dampens the amount of new development and adds significantly to its costs[^”1”]. To streamline this process, cities can initiate a comprehensive review of the approval process and then can reduce or eliminate obstacles[^”1”]. This will stimulate development activity and moderate the price pressure on existing house stock[^”1”].

In addition to reviewing and streamlining the approval process, cities can choose to expediate higher density housing, convert unused malls and offices to housing[^”2”], and permit accessory dwelling units[^”3”]. All of these together will increase the housing supply and reduce the cost of housing.

## Calculations


## Implementation
Implementation can start at the city, town or county level. Reviews of the approval process as well as gathering ideas and strategies can be roundtable discussions, public forums, and surveys[^”1”]. Permitting offices of local and state levels will need to be involved and will handle any rezoning, variances, or land use amendments[^”1”].
