The price of housing is ultimately determined by supply and demand. Zoning restrictions suppress housing supply and drive up costs. We advocate in particular additional permitting of smaller houses and apartments due to their environmental performance. Cities can increase supply in several ways.
- Steamling permitting [^"15"], such as has been pursued by Lincoln, Nebraska [^"37"].
- [Loosing zoning regulations](/cities/cities_land_use/cities_zoning_rules), particularly to permit higher density housing, smaller units, housing on smaller lots, and to relax parking minima.
- Expedite permitting of certain kinds of housing, such as duplexes, to increase infill housing supply, such as envisioned by California's Senate Bill 9, the H.O.M.E. Act [^"3"].
- Convert unused offices or malls to housing [^"16"].
- State or local legislation to expedite the permitting of accessory dwelling units, also known as 'granny flats', such as Oregon's HB 2001 in 2019 [^"2"].
