## Description
We propose expanding responsible whale watching, taking efforts to mitigate any harm to the whale populations and their environments.

## Background
Whale watching boosts the economy of coastal towns and give the residents a sense of pride and stewardship towards whale populations [^"1"]. Occurring in 119 countries, there are about 15 million whale watchers every year with a rate increase of 18% per year [^"2"].

Responsible whale watching that includes an educational element fosters an appreciation for wildlife in its natural habitat and an awareness of whale conservation needs, and whale watching vessels can serve to collect data on whale distribution, habitat use, and other studies [^"1"].


## Calculations
Whale watching tourism generated an estimated $2.1 billion and employed 13,000 people worldwide in 2009 [^"1"],[^"2"], serving 13 million tourists [^"5"], with potential for an additional $413 million of revenue and 5,700 jobs [^"3"].

The estimated cost of adhering to sector regulations, including a tracking system, is $3,400 per business in the first year and $625 per business in ongoing annual operations and maintenance costs, approximately 0.1 percent of average annual industry revenues [^"4"].


## Implementation

It is important to mitigate the potential of negative effects to whale populations that are targeted for tourism [^"1"], which include disruption feeding and resting disruptions and collisions between whales and boats [^"5"]. An appropriate mitigation strategy is the establishment of spatial refuges that are free of boat traffic [^"5"].

A lack of infrastructure or perceived lack of opportunity for entering the whale watching market can prevent developing countries from realizing the benefits of whale watching [^"3"].

Due to the risk of disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry may benefit from a [virtual travel](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/transport/transpo_ghg) option.
