## Description
We propose expanding responsible whale watching, taking efforts to mitigate any harm to the whale populations and their environments.

## Background
Whale watching can boost the economy of coastal towns and give the residents a sense of pride and stewardships towards the whale populations that provide this[^”1”]. Occurring in 119 countries, there are about 15 million whale watchers every year with a rate increase of 18% per year[^”2”].

Responsible whale watching that includes an educational element fosters an appreciation for wildlife in its natural habitat and an awareness of whale conservation needs[^”1”].

Whale watching vessels can serve to collect data on whale distribution, habitat use, and other studies[^”1”].

## Calculations
Whale watching tourism is estimated to generate $2.1 billion and provide employment for over 13,000 people worldwide in 2009[^”1”], [^”2”]. With room to generate an additional $413 million and add 5,700 jobs[^”3”].

## Implementation

It is important to mitigate the potential of negative effects to whale populations that are targeted for tourism[^”1”].

A lack of infrastructure or perceived lack of opportunity for entering the whale watching market can prevent developing countries from realizing the benefits of whale watching[^”3”].
