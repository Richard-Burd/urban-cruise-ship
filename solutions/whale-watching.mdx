## Description
We propose expanding responsible whale watching, taking efforts to mitigate any harm to the whale populations and their environments.

## Background
Whale watching can boost the economy of coastal towns and give the residents a sense of pride and stewardships towards the whale populations that provide this[^”1”]. Occurring in 119 countries, there are about 15 million whale watchers every year with a rate increase of 18% per year[^”2”].

Responsible whale watching that includes an educational element fosters an appreciation for wildlife in its natural habitat and an awareness of whale conservation needs[^”1”].

Whale watching vessels can serve to collect data on whale distribution, habitat use, and other studies[^”1”].


## Calculations
Whale watching tourism is estimated to generate $2.1 billion and provide employment for over 13,000 people worldwide in 2009[^”1”], [^”2”]. With room to generate an additional $413 million and add 5,700 jobs[^”3”].

The estimated cost of adhering to sector regulations (including a tracking system) is $3,400 per business in the first year and $625 per business in ongoing annual operations and maintenance costs[^”4”]. This represents approximately 0.1 percent of average annual industry revenues[^”4”].


## Implementation

It is important to mitigate the potential of negative effects to whale populations that are targeted for tourism[^”1”].

A lack of infrastructure or perceived lack of opportunity for entering the whale watching market can prevent developing countries from realizing the benefits of whale watching[^”3”].

Pandemic events such as COVID 19 can severely decrease revenues, the industry may benefit from creating some kind of [virtual travel](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/transport/transpo_ghg) option to mitigate those losses.
