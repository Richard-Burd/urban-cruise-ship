## Description

We recommend employers incorporate genetic testing as a part of cardiovascular disease screening to better assess disease risk.

## Background

Cardiovascular diseases, particularly coronary artery disease (CAD), are influenced by both traditional risk factors and genetic predispositions. Standard workplace healthcare programs typically focus on traditional risk factors (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol) without considering genetic predispositions. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) analyze genetic makeup to enhance the precision of risk assessments [^"1"]. Integrating CAD-PRS alongside traditional risk factors could improve prevention efforts for CAD [^"4"].

Of the 161 million employees in the United States [^"2"], we estimate 94 million employees would be impacted by this enhanced screening [^"3"]. We estimate that half of these employees are offered a workplace health program, based on a statistic that 55% of all companies offer a workplace health program [^"5"]. 

## Implementation

Workplace wellness plans have been shown to improve employee morale and health behaviors [^"7"], and half of employees have stated that they stayed with their current employer due to the healthcare [^"8"]. Genetic testing has been shown to be cost effective at reducing employer cost and unlike some health interventions, the testing has a one-time cost [^"1"].
