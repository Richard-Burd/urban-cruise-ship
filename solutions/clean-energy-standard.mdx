## Description


We recommend the United States Congress implement the 80x30 clean energy standard as proposed by the Clean Energy Futures project, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2030. [^"9"]

## Background

Renewable portfolio standards are mandates that a utility procures a certain percentage of its electricity from particular sources. Such policies are meant to aid the development of targeted technologies, including solar power. We advocate instead a Clean Energy Standard, which would incentivize energy generation technologies based on their characteristics (e.g. low carbon emissions) without specifying technologies. [^"4"]

This program sets clean energy goals for all power suppliers in the form of carbon emission per unit of electricity, starting at **0.82 metric tons CO₂ per MWh** and becoming more stringent over time.  [^"5"]

Clean energy credit banking is one of the key drivers of this program. It involves the creation and trading of clean energy credits (earned through meeting emission goals) which represent a specific amount of renewable energy or avoided carbon emissions. They can be bought and sold, or banked for future years when the standards are more strict. [^"9"]

Credit banking is predicted to cause air and health benefits to come sooner, however, fossil fuel use is used for a longer period compared with similar programs without banking. [^"9"] [^"5"]

#### Costs and benefits are averaged over a 30-year span. [^"9"] [^"5"] [^"6"]

Health benefits derived from improved air quality and its impact on cardiovascular, respiratory, and birth-related health issues. [^"9"]
Environmental impact derived from the social cost of carbon. [^"9"]

Other benefits predicted by 2030 include
- a 71% decrease in NOₓ emissions from electricity production [^"9"]
- a 96% decrease in SO₂ and mercury emissions from electricity production [^"9"]
- 2 million asthma attacks averted annually (growing to 12 million annually by 2050) [^"9"]
- 50,000 premature deaths (317,500 by 2050) [^"9"]

These costs represent a 13% increase in costs compared to business-as-usual models for the energy sector.  [^"5"]

By 2030, fuel costs plummet by $35.4 Billion USD as the energy sector becomes dominated by renewable sources. [^"6"]

The largest reductions of pollutants after policy implementation occur in the eastern US due to the reliance on coal. [^"9"] [^"6"]


## Implementation


Clean Energy Standards have been proposed in the past but have failed due to Senate rules. [^"1"] [^"2"] Congress could implement this under a reconciliation process, requiring a simple majority as opposed to a new law. [^"3"]


The credit banking program could be administered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) which has a mission to keep energy costs to consumers down. [^"8"]


Electric vehicle use, though not modeled here, would magnify the air quality benefits seen here despite increasing electric generating emissions. [5]
