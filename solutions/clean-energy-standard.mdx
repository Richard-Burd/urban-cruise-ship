Renewable portfolio standards are mandates that a utility procures a certain percentage of its electricity from particular sources. Such policies are meant to aid the development of the targeted technologies, including solar power. We advocate instead a Clean Energy Standard, which would mandate energy generation technologies based on their characteristics (e.g. low carbon emissions) without specifying technologies [^"4"]. A clean energy standard would aid development of a range of clean energy sources: solar, wind, geothermal, and nuclear.
