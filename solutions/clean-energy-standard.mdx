## Description


We recommend the United States Congress implement the 80x30 clean energy standard as proposed by the Clean Energy Futures project, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2030 [^"9"].

## Background

Renewable portfolio standards are mandates that utilities procures a given percentage of their electricity from particular sources, such as solar or wind power. Such policies are intended to aid the development of targeted technologies. We advocate instead a Clean Energy Standard, which would incentivize energy generation technologies based on their characteristics (e.g. low carbon emissions) without specifying technologies [^"4"].

The 80x30 proposal sets clean energy goals for all power suppliers in the form of carbon emission per unit of electricity, starting at **0.82 metric tons CO₂ per MWh** and becoming more stringent over time [^"5"].

The proposal entails clean energy credit banking, which allows the creation and trading of clean energy credits, earned through meeting emission goals, which represent a specific amount of renewable energy or avoided carbon emissions and can be bought and sold, or banked for future years when the standards [^"9"]. Credit banking is expected to cause air and health benefits to come sooner, but also to prolong the use of fossil fuels [^"9"],[^"5"].

#### Costs and benefits are averaged over 30 years [^"9"],[^"5"],[^"6"].

Health benefits are based on improved air quality and its impact on cardiovascular, respiratory, and birth-related health issues [^"9"].
Environmental impact are based on the social cost of carbon of $50/ton [^"9"].

Other benefits expected by 2030 include a 71% decreased in NOₓ emissions from electricity, a 96% decrease in SO₂ and mercury emissions, and the avoidance of 50,000 annual premature deaths (318 thousand in 2050) and 2 million asmtha attacks (12 million in 2050) [^"9"].

#### Costs and benefits are averaged over 30 years [^"9"],[^"5"],[^"6"].


These costs are 13% above costs compared to the business-as-usual trajectory [^"5"]. By 2030, fuel costs will fall by $35.4 billion as renewable sources become prevalent [^"6"]. The largest reductions of pollutants occur in the eastern U.S. due to that region's reliance on coal [^"9"],[^"6"].


## Implementation


Clean Energy Standards have been proposed in the past but have failed due to Senate rules [^"1"],[^"2"]. Congress could implement this under a reconciliation process, requiring a simple majority as opposed to a new law [^"3"].


The credit banking program could be administered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) which has a mission to keep energy costs to consumers down [^"8"].


Electric vehicle use, though not modeled here, would magnify the air quality benefits despite increasing electric generating emissions [^"5"].
