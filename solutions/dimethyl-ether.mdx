## Description
We recommend converting fleets of trucks from diesel to dimethyl ether (DME).

## Background
Methanol can be easily refined to form dimethyl ether, a fuel that is an effective substitute for diesel. DME can also be made from biostock including “black liquor” which is organic refuse produced by the forestry industry[^"9"]. Black liquor is produced as a waste stream from the pulping process thus no foodstocks or farmable acreage is used[^"9"].

Compared to diesel, DME has vastly superior cold starting, is smokeless, quieter combustion, no fuel waxing in cold climates to clog fuel lines, low NOx emissions, requires lower injection pressure in the fuel system, lower well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions, and is potentially a CO2 absorber in its production[^"8"]. Because DME fuel produces no soot or smoke, the reduction in air pollution would reduce healthcare costs and increase quality of life[^"10"].

Conversion of a diesel engine to DME does not require modifications to diesel engine internal structures or components, however it does require major modifications to the fuel system[^"8"]. The main challenge in developing engine fuel systems for DME are associated with its low boiling temperature of -24°C and its low critical temperature of 127°C[^"8"]. This can make retrofitting complicated and expensive, so our recommendation is to replace old fleets with new ones specifically designed to run on DME.

The physical properties of DME are very similar to propane, so the distribution and dispensing infrastructure is assumed to be similar. As long as the fleet is using a steady amount of DME, the supplier will install the refueling infrastructure for the fleet, usually with no extra charge[^"8"]. DME has consistent fueling with no “short-fills” caused by pressure loss and can be stored in the hot sun with no boiling off or venting[^"11"].

## Calculations
While DME reduces tailpipe exhaust GHG by around 11%, the total well-to-wheel reduction is around 70-95% depending on the feedstock used[^"9"], [^"10"].

With DME’s cost per diesel equivalent and the cost of the DME truck being competitive or even cheaper than a diesel truck[^"11"], there is very little to no cost in switching fleets over from diesel to DME. The main concern is the fueling infrastructure as the trucks will need to return to the fleet hub for refueling.


## Implementation
DME can also be an effective substitute for other diesel applications, such as shipping [^"1"]. DME has replaced CFC gases (freons) as an environmentally friendly and safe aerosol propellant, can be blended with propane for use in spark-ignited LPG engines, and in the future could be a source of hydrogen for fuel cells[^"7"]. As of 2008, China had 9 million tons of installed DME capacity annually[^"7"].

While initial capital expenditures may be high, the operating cost of DME vehicles is lower due to reduced fuel costs and lower maintenance requirements[^"10"]. Wider adoption of DME vehicles will lead to job creation in DME production and distribution[^"10"].

DME has about half the energy content of diesel fuel, so a truck would need twice the amount of fueling tanks to keep the same range[^"11"]. This extra fuel would make the trucks heavier and initially it may be advantageous to keep DME trucks on shorter routes[^"11"].
