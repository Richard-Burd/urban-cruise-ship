## Background

Dimethyl ether, refined from methanol, substitutes for diesel. The predominant feedstock for DME in the United States is natural gas, and others include coal, biomass [^"21"], and electrolysis [^"20"]. A potential biostock is black liquor, a waste stream from pulping without dedicated foodstocks or farmable acreage [^"9"].

The air pollution advantages of DME, compared to diesel, include superior cold starting, smokelessness, quieter combustion, no fuel waxing in cold climates to clog fuel lines, low NOx emissions, lowerer injection pressure, lower well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions, and is potentially a CO<sub>2</sub> absorber [^"8"]. Compared to diesel, DME reduces tailpipe exhaust greenhouse gas emissions by around 11% and well-to-wheel emissions by 70-95%, depending on feedstock [^"9"], [^"10"].


## Calculations

Our cost estimates are based on the cost of manufacturing DME, specifically from sewer sludge [^"12"]. While we do not expect that sewer sludge is sufficient to provide enough DME for all trucking needs, we take these cost estimates as representative. Benefits are based on a replaced diesel price of $3 per gallon, a recent typical price [^"13"]. Greenhouse gas savings estimates are computed based on standard estimates of the greenhouse gas intensity of diesel [^"14"], while no net emissions are modeled for bio-DME [^"15"].

We model about 2.7 trillion ton-miles of freight shipped by truck each year in the United States as of 2022 [^"16"], of which 76% are carried by diesel trucks [^"17"].

Dimethyl ether refined from electrolyzed methanol would yield similar greenhouse gas savings [^"20"] and avoid the feedstock limitations and land use requirements of biofuels, but at present, electrolyzed DME is prohibitively expensive [^"18"].

There is considerable uncertainty in our calculations regarding the cost and greenhouse gas intensity of bio-DME. We have also not quantified costs of retrofitting trucks to use DME, the necessary fueling infrastructure, and air pollution benefits of DME [^"19"].


## Implementation

Conversion of a diesel engine to DME does not require modifications to internal structures or components, but it does require major modifications to the fuel system [^"8"]. We therefore expect DME introduction will occur through fleet turnover rather than engine retrofits. The distribution and dispensing infrastructure is expected to be similar to that of propane. As long as the fleet is using a steady amount of DME, the supplier will install the refueling infrastructure for the fleet, usually with no extra charge [^"8"]. DME has consistent fueling with no "short-fills" caused by pressure loss and can be stored in the hot sun with no boiling off or venting [^"11"].

Beyond trucking applications, DMB is an alternative fuel for shipping [^"1"], a replacement for CFC gases (freons) as an aerosol propellant, can be blended with propane for use in spark-ignited LPG engines, and may be a hydrogen source for fuel cells [^"7"]. As of 2008, China had nine million tons of installed annual DME capacity [^"7"].

Due to lower energy density, a truck would need twice the fueling tank capacity for a given range [^"11"], increasing weight and perhaps rendering DME trucks optimal for short routes. This effect is not modeled in our calculations.
