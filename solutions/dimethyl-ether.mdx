Methanol can be easily refined to form dimethyl ether, a fuel that is an effective substitute for diesel. We estimate the following costs and benefits of upgrading a fleet of trucks to use dimethyl ether instead of diesel.

DME can also be an effective substitute for other diesel applications, such as shipping [^"1"].
