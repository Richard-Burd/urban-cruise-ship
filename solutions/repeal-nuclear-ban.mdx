## Description
We recommend that U.S. states repeal bans and restrictions on new nuclear power plants.

## Background
As of 2023, of the 50 U.S. states, 12 have heavy restrictions or outright bans on new nuclear plants: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont [^"1"]. These bans make it nearly impossible to build new nuclear plants in these states. Some, however, have nuclear power plants that predate the bans.

With an increase in renewable energy production such as solar and wind, it is important to have consistent and stable clean energy production in the mix as well. While nuclear power plants often operate at a steady "baseload" production, they are capable of flexible operation to further enhance compatibility with renewable energy grids[^"6"]. If nuclear flexibility is integrated into renewable grids it could lower power systems operating costs, increase reactor owner revenues, and substantially reduce curtailment of renewables[^"6"].

## Calculations
We estimate that 26 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year could be reduced by repealing the 12 bans. We estimate the [social cost of carbon](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/energy/energy_socioeconomics/carbon_pricing_e) at $141.40 per ton, as a $3.68 billion annual benefit.
This figure is estimated as follows. Absent a ban, the amount of new nuclear that would be constructed in each state would be equal to the share of nuclear energy in the United States electricity mix today, which is about 18% [^"3"], except in Vermont, where the electricity mix already has low emissions. The emissions intensity of nuclear power is taken to be 50 grams CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh [^"2"]. The new nuclear is assumed to replace a portfolio of electricity generation that is equal to the state's average intensity [^"4"].

The average cost of an enacted bill of state legislature in 2020 was $125,083.89[^"5"]. We assume that repealing a ban would have a similar cost, multiplied by 12 for each state where the bans need to be removed. This would add up to a cost of $1.5 million.

## Implementation
For new nuclear power to play a significant role in the American power grid, more reforms than repealing state-level moratoria are needed. Those reforms are described elsewhere in this section. We do not expect that repealing the moratoria, without addressing other barriers to nuclear power, will result in a significant amount of new nuclear power being built.
